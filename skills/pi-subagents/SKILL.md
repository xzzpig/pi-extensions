name: pi-subagents
description: |
  Delegate to builtin or custom subagents for single-agent handoffs, parallel
  review, scripted chaining, async work, forked context, and coordinated
  workflows. Use when one parent agent should stay in control while children
  supply focused context, planning, review, or execution.

# Pi Subagents

Choose a mode:

- **Direct mode:** For tiny or focused work, the parent handles the task
  directly; a single bounded child handoff is fine. Skip workflow ceremony.
- **Orchestrator mode:** For substantial or delegated work, the parent is the
  supervisor, arbiter, and authority holder—not the routine primary doer.
  Subagents may own planning/design, scouting, implementation,
  simplification/challenge, validation, and review as useful. The parent keeps
  user intent, constraints, authority, routing, arbitration, final acceptance,
  and publication.
- A useful loop for substantial work is **writer → challenge/simplify → review**;
  the parent arbitrates between steps, and tiny tasks can skip it.
- Direct parent edits during orchestrator mode should be intentional, small
  interventions with a brief reason.

Children do not spawn subagents unless the parent explicitly delegated fanout
and their resolved `tools` allow `subagent`.

## Launch shape

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| One bounded task for one child | direct `{ agent, task }` |
| JavaScript control flow or data-dependent branching; sequence, fanout, retry, rolling fanout, or aggregation | `workflowScript` with `runs.run(...)` / `runs.all(...)` |
| A broad plan split into visible narrow stages per lane | `workflowScript` with `runs.lanes([{ key, stages: [...] }])` |
| Independent worktree or repository lanes | `references/multi-lane-orchestration.md` |
| Council of advisors | `../council-mode/SKILL.md` |
| Management, status, steering, authoring, or inspection | `action` |

`workflowScript` is code-driven: `runs.run(...)` for keyed steps,
`runs.all([...])` for fanout, plain JavaScript for branching and aggregation.
Keep scripts portable: use top-level `await`, plain helpers, or explicit Promise
chains, not nested async helpers. Legacy top-level `chain` / `tasks` inputs and
durable `.chain.md` execution are inspection or migration material only.

Use `runs.lanes(...)` only inside a `workflowScript`, not as a top-level mode,
when a broad, predeclared plan benefits from visible per-lane stages; otherwise
use ordinary `runs.run(...)` / `runs.all(...)`. See the [canonical staged-lane
example](../../docs/workflows.md#parallel-sequential-lanes). Keep assignments
bounded, but do not add stages or ceremony just to satisfy this skill.

Use async/background by default. Set `async:false` only when the parent must
block. Final reviews, validation gates, oracle checks, and publication checks
stay async.

In an ordinary interactive session, yield after launching or triaging useful
async lanes and let Pi wake the parent on completion; ordinary async subagents
already have native completion notifications, so do not call `bg_wait()` merely
because a child is active. Use blocking `bg_wait()` only for provider,
detached, or other background work without a native notification when a
headless/run-to-completion contract or a required same-turn artifact makes the
result necessary before this turn ends. For
“continue/orchestrate/work until done,” keep the lane board moving while a safe
immediate action remains; if only async lanes are running, record the revisit
trigger and yield.

Package agents appear in `subagent({ action: "list" })`. External CLI/job agents
use their own runner contract. Do not pass native Pi child options to them unless
that runner explicitly supports the option.

## Read the reference for the branch

| Branch | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Delegate or choose roles, prompts, models, or slash commands | `references/prompting-and-roles.md` |
| Execute single, scripted, async, scheduled, mission, forked, watchdog, oracle, or intercom workflows | `references/execution-controls.md` |
| Review, validate, triage gate failures, or prepare delivery | `references/review-and-validation.md` |
| Coordinate lanes, worktrees, repositories, or writer waves | `references/multi-lane-orchestration.md` |
| List, create, edit, disable, eject, or expose agents/RPC | `references/management-authoring-rpc.md` |
| Check safety constraints, recipes, or error handling | `references/constraints-and-recipes.md` |

For complex work, read `prompting-and-roles.md` and `execution-controls.md`, then
load `review-and-validation.md` and `constraints-and-recipes.md` before launch or
review.

## Operating rules

- Avoid duplicate scouts, overlapping writers, and vague prompts without a concrete deliverable.
- Keep the parent on the ordinary strong default model. Route workers/scouts to a fast capable tier, serious reviews to a strong tier, and top reasoning to bounded read-only critique.
- Exact model names are deployment policy. Put them in user/project settings or profiles, not package guidance.
- Give every child a compact meta-prompt checklist: objective; repo/cwd/ref; authority/edit boundary; relevant files/contracts and constraints; success/acceptance criteria; validation; expected output/report; and stop/ask conditions. See `references/prompting-and-roles.md`.
- For mutation work, use an isolated lane/worktree when isolation, overlap, or concurrent juggling matters; keep one writer per cwd/worktree. See `references/multi-lane-orchestration.md` for lane mechanics.
- Keep long/high-output validation out of chat: prefer `interactive_shell` dispatch/background monitors, bounded logs, or subagent-owned reports; return a concise summary plus report path unless same-turn output is required. See `references/execution-controls.md`.
- For cross-codebase work, record the repo, explicit `cwd`, authority boundary, and expected output before launch.
- Make parallel prompts distinct by source seam, evidence, and decision. Do not clone prompts with only item numbers swapped.
- Prefer fresh-context review/validation fanout, then synthesize and apply fixes in the parent.
- For Pi extension repos under `~/.pi/agent/extensions`, put lane worktrees outside extension auto-discovery, such as `~/.pi/agent/worktrees`.
- Preserve capability ceilings, including child tool limits and allowed-agent restrictions.
- Preserve parent authority and escalate unresolved choices.
- Treat receipts, CI, review bots, and external-run records as evidence, not authority.
- For backlog maintenance, releases, merge queues, or other public-repo mutation policy, load the matching user/project skill. This package defines delegation primitives, not private policy.
- As a conservative orchestration policy, do not pass a hard `toolBudget` or tight `usageBudget` to mutation-capable workers. The default tool budget blocks read/search tools rather than mutation tools. If interrupted after a tool call starts, checkpoint after the current tool returns with changed files, build/test state, and commit or PR state.
