# Architecture

This document describes the internal design of the permission system, informed by [OpenCode's permission model](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/).

## Design principles

1. **Unified rule model** - one `Rule` type, one evaluation function, all surfaces.
2. **Pure evaluation** - permission decisions are pure functions of (surface, pattern, rules).
   IO stays at the edges.
3. **Session approvals are just more rules** - no separate matching engine, no separate pre-check.
4. **MCP stays special** - multi-name target derivation is pre-processing, not a special evaluation path.
5. **Defaults are rules** - the universal default (`permission["*"]`) is synthesized as a low-priority rule in the array.
   No side-channel fallbacks.
6. **Flat config format** - the flat `permission: { ... }` object where each key is a surface.
   The config IS the ruleset in human-friendly form.
   Capability is a suffix on the surface name, not a nested facet (`path_read`, `external_directory_write`), and a bare `path` / `external_directory` key is load-time sugar expanding into both directions — so every channel keeps speaking one flat `(surface, pattern)` vocabulary ([ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-permission-policy-model.md) §3, §4).
7. **Preserve the two-phase model** - tool filtering (before_agent_start) and invocation gating (tool_call) remain separate.
8. **Ask = cache miss** - "ask" is the absence of a matching rule.
   The human is the oracle.
   Their decision is a rule.
   Persistence determines lifetime (once / session / config).
9. **Single-agent core, multi-agent by extension** - Pi is single-agent by deliberate design; the notion of multiple named agents is introduced entirely by external extensions (pi-subagents, pi-agent-router, some MasuRii packages), not by Pi itself.
   Per-agent `permission:` frontmatter is therefore an extension bridge layered on this single-agent core, not a core responsibility.
   The package learns the active agent from a generic `<active_agent>` signal (a system-prompt tag or an `active_agent` session entry), never from a hard dependency on any one multi-agent extension, so the bridge works with any tool that emits the signal.

## Scope and non-goals

The README carries a short charter for the boundaries that come up most often.
This is the full inventory, with the decision record or design principle each rests on.

Two entries rest on an operator position rather than a decision record, and are marked as such above.

The following are **not** boundaries, and must not be written as such.
Durable persistence of an approval is anticipated by design principle 8 and §"Authority lives in three places", which reserve a place for a ruling that outlives the session.
Whether a capability model replaces the actor-keyed surface list is settled: [ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-permission-policy-model.md) adds read/write capability as an axis beside the existing keys, so direction becomes expressible on `path` and on the boundary.
Which channels policy may enter through remains open in issue #799.
Multi-hop escalation, three-way grant scope, terminal-replacement registration, and non-TUI presentation are admitted-not-shipped or externally blocked, not declined.

## Core data model

### Rule

```typescript
/**
 * Provenance of a rule - which source contributed it.
 *
 * Config scopes: "global", "project", "agent", "project-agent".
 * Synthesized:   "builtin" (universal default / evaluate() fallback),
 *                "baseline" (conditional MCP metadata auto-allow).
 * Runtime:       "session" (session approvals).
 * Rewrite:       "yolo" (composition-stage ask→allow rewrite under yolo mode),
 *                "fail-closed" (composition-stage allow→ask floor when an
 *                invalid non-global config scope is detected).
 */
type RuleOrigin =
  | "global"
  | "project"
  | "agent"
  | "project-agent"
  | "builtin"
  | "baseline"
  | "session"
  | "yolo"
  | "fail-closed";

interface Rule {
  /** The permission surface: "bash", "edit", "mcp", "skill", "external_directory", "path", etc. */
  surface: string;
  /** The match pattern: a command glob, tool name, file path, skill name, or "*". */
  pattern: string;
  /** The decision. */
  action: PermissionState;
  /** Custom denial reason for deny rules (optional). */
  reason?: string;
  /**
   * Origin layer - used to derive PermissionCheckResult.source after evaluation.
   * Not used by evaluate(); purely informational metadata.
   */
  layer?: "default" | "baseline" | "config" | "session";
  /** Which source contributed this rule. */
  origin: RuleOrigin;
}
```

Every config entry, default policy, session approval, and agent override normalizes into `Rule[]`.

### Ruleset

```typescript
type Ruleset = Rule[];
```

Merge precedence is array ordering.
The synthesized universal default goes first (lowest priority), then MCP baseline auto-allow rules, then config rules (global → project → agent → project-agent), and finally session rules (highest priority).
Last-match-wins: `evaluate()` scans from the end.

### Evaluate

```typescript
function evaluate(
  surface: string,
  value: string,
  rules: Ruleset,
  platform: NodeJS.Platform,
): Rule {
  for (let i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const rule = rules[i];
    // On win32 a path-surface match folds case + separators; `platform` is
    // injected from `PermissionManager` (read once at the composition root,
    // #510), never `process.platform` ambiently.
    if (ruleMatches(rule, surface, value, platform)) {
      return rule;
    }
  }
  // Unreachable when defaults are synthesized - the catch-all always matches.
  return { surface, pattern: value, action: "ask" };
}
```

The entire decision engine.
When defaults are synthesized into the array, the catch-all `{ surface: "*", pattern: "*", action: "ask" }` always matches - the fallback return is defensive only.

## Composed ruleset

All rule sources are concatenated into a single flat array.
Index position determines priority (higher index wins):

```

`synthesizeDefaults()` produces a single universal catch-all from `permission["*"]`.
Per-surface catch-alls (e.g. `bash: { "*": "allow" }`) are expressed as regular config rules via `normalizeFlatConfig()` - no separate override layer is needed.

`synthesizeBaseline()` conditionally emits MCP metadata auto-allow rules.

`composeRuleset()` concatenates: defaults + baseline + config rules.
Session rules are concatenated after config rules so `evaluate()` handles them via last-match-wins - no separate per-branch pre-check.

### Default synthesis

```typescript
// Single universal catch-all from permission["*"].
function synthesizeDefaults(universalDefault: PermissionState): Ruleset {
  return [
    { surface: "*", pattern: "*", action: universalDefault, layer: "default" },
  ];
}

// MCP metadata auto-allow - only synthesized when any config rule has
// surface: "mcp" && action: "allow".
function synthesizeBaseline(configRules: Ruleset): Ruleset { ... }

// Concat in priority order: defaults, baseline, config.
function composeRuleset(defaults, baseline, config): Ruleset {
  return [...defaults, ...baseline, ...config];
}
```

The `Agent frontmatter` input (`AF`) is the per-agent override layer.
It only carries data when an external multi-agent extension is active (see design principle 9): the package resolves the active agent's name from a generic `<active_agent>` signal, then reads the `permission:` sub-document of that agent's definition file at `<cwd>/.pi/agents/<name>.md` (project) or `<agentDir>/agents/<name>.md` (global).
The package does not discover or enumerate agents — it reads one sub-document by name, on demand — and the `<cwd>/.pi/agents` location is a Pi platform convention this package encodes independently (no dependency on pi-subagents, ADR 0002).

## Config format

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "*": "ask",
    "read": "allow",
    "bash": { "*": "allow", "git *": "allow", "npm *": "allow", "rm *": "deny" },
    "mcp": { "*": "ask", "exa:*": "allow" },
    "skill": { "*": "ask", "librarian": "allow" },
    "path": { "*": "allow", "*.env": "deny" },
    "external_directory": "ask"
  }
}
```

Each top-level key in `permission` is a surface name.
A string value is shorthand for `{ "*": action }` (surface-level catch-all).
An object value maps patterns to actions.
`permission["*"]` is the universal fallback.

### Normalization to Rule[]

`normalizeFlatConfig` (`src/normalize.ts`) flattens each `permission` entry into `Rule`s: a string value expands to a single surface catch-all (`{ surface, pattern: "*", action }`), and an object value expands each `pattern → action` pair to one `Rule`.

Ahead of it, `expandDirectionalSugar` runs once per scope inside `mergeScopesWithOrigins`, rewriting a bare `path` / `external_directory` key into its two directional members so origins stay attributed to the authoring scope.
After expansion no rule lives on a bare family surface; `PermissionResolver.resolve` answers a bare-family query by folding the members most-restrictive.

## MCP pre-processing

MCP is the one surface that requires pre-processing **before** evaluation.
The multi-name target derivation stays, but it feeds candidate values into `evaluate()` rather than a separate code path:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Input["MCP tool call input"] --> Derive["createMcpTargets(input)"]
    Derive --> Candidates["[exa_search, exa:search, exa, search, mcp_call]"]
    Candidates --> Loop{"For each candidate"}
    Loop --> Eval["evaluate('mcp', candidate, rules)"]
    Eval --> Found{"Explicit match?"}
    Found -->|Yes| Return["Return rule"]
    Found -->|No| Next["Next candidate"]
    Next --> Loop
    Loop -->|Exhausted| Fallback["evaluate('mcp', '*', rules)<br/>(hits synthesized default)"]
```

The priority ordering of candidates is preserved.
The evaluation function is unchanged - MCP just calls it multiple times with different values.
MCP target derivation helpers live in `src/access-intent/mcp-targets.ts`.
Input normalization for all surfaces lives in `src/access-intent/input-normalizer.ts`.

### Path-bearing tool normalization

Per-tool path patterns — e.g. `"read": { "*": "allow", "*.env": "deny" }` — are evaluated via the `access-path` intent the per-tool gate emits ([#502]).
When the pipeline calls `resolvePerToolCheck`, a present `input.path` triggers `normalizer.forPath(path)` and an `access-path` intent on the tool-name surface; the resolver unwraps it to `path-values` carrying the lexical ∪ canonical alias set before the manager evaluates the rule.
When `input.path` is missing or empty, the pipeline falls back to a `tool` intent, which `normalizeInput` collapses to `["*"]` (surface catch-all).
Path alias derivation (home-expansion, cwd-relative aliases) lives in `getPathPolicyValues` / `AccessPath` — not in `normalizeInput`, which no longer touches path surfaces (#504).
`getToolPermission()` is unaffected — it still evaluates with `"*"`, reporting the surface's own catch-all.
Tool injection no longer asks it: it asks `isToolFullyDenied()`, which probes every pattern configured on the surface (see [Phase 1](#phase-1-tool-filtering-before_agent_start)).

The cross-cutting `path` and `external_directory` gates extract paths for **extension and MCP tools too** (#352): `describePathGate` and `describeExternalDirectoryGate` call `getToolInputPath`, which reads `input.path` for built-ins, `input.arguments.path` for MCP, and a registered `ToolAccessExtractor` (or the default `input.path` convention) for any other tool.
The extractor registry (`src/tool-access-extractor-registry.ts`) is created once in `index.ts` and shared: its lookup side is threaded into `ToolCallGatePipeline` (wrapped in the inheriting lookup below), and its registrar side is exposed cross-extension via `PermissionsService.registerToolAccessExtractor`.
Per-tool path maps for extension tools (a custom extractor key per tool) are a deferred follow-up.

A lookup that misses falls back to this node's **ancestors** in the same process (`src/authority/inherited-registrations.ts`), so a subagent child whose own registry has no extractor for a tool still sees the path that tool touches.
This is ADR 0012 decision 1's fact-shaping clause: an extractor produces a fact and decides nothing, so its *lookup* may cross an in-process node boundary while its *registration* stays node-local.
`getToolInputPath` reports which of the three sources answered, and a decision resolved from an ancestor carries `extractorSource: "inherited"` in its review-log context.
The authorizer registry has no such fallback, and `PermissionsService` deliberately exposes no reader for it — a link returns a verdict, so live authority stays converged at the adjudicating node (ADR 0007 §7).

On the bash side, which argument tokens count as filesystem operands is settled by [ADR 0009](../decisions/0009-bash-path-projection-completeness-contract.md): candidacy comes from the filesystem (a bare token is a path candidate iff it names an existing entry), the decision comes from explicit rules or the external boundary, and the ADR names both what the projection guarantees and which gaps are accepted residuals rather than bugs.
A plain `$HOME` / `${HOME}` / `$PWD` / `${PWD}` reference is resolved at token collection, upstream of classification, so an expanded token is gated exactly as its literal spelling; the resolvable set is closed at those two names by the same ADR.

## Session approvals: the cache-miss model

Session rules are stored as `Ruleset` and are generalized to all surfaces.

`evaluate()` is a **lookup** against cached decisions.
When no rule matches (or the matching rule says "ask"), the system has a cache miss - it needs the human oracle to produce a decision.

The human's response is simultaneously:

1. **The answer** for this request (allow or deny).
2. **A rule** that can be cached for future lookups.

The dialog determines **persistence** - where the rule lives:

```text
  evaluate(surface, value, composedRules)
       │
       ├── match.action = "allow" → proceed (cache hit)
       ├── match.action = "deny"  → block (cache hit)
       │
       └── match.action = "ask"   → cache miss, query oracle
                │
                ▼
           Dialog: "[surface] wants to [value]"
                │
                ├── "Yes"              → allow this request (no persistence)
                ├── "Yes, for session" → allow + store in session layer
                │                        (future lookups hit without asking)
                ├── "No"               → deny this request (no persistence)
                └── (future: "Always") → allow + store in config layer (disk)
```

### Pattern suggestions

When prompting, each surface suggests a **pattern** for the "for session" option.
The pattern determines what class of future requests auto-approve:

| Surface                | Input value                 | Suggested session pattern   | Mechanism                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| bash                   | `git checkout main`         | `git checkout *`            | Arity table              |
| bash                   | `npm run dev`               | `npm run dev`               | Arity table              |
| tool (read/write/etc.) | tool surface itself         | `*` (all uses of that tool) | Tool-level               |
| mcp                    | `exa:search`                | `exa:*`                     | Server-level wildcard    |
| skill                  | `librarian`                 | `librarian`                 | Exact name               |
| external_directory     | `/other/project/src/foo.ts` | `/other/project/*`          | Directory prefix as glob |

The suggestion is shown in the dialog text so the user sees what they're approving:

```text
  ● Allow once
  ● Allow "git checkout *" for this session
  ● Deny
```

## Prompt presentation

What a prompt must show, what a renderer may elide, and what bounds its size are settled by [ADR 0011](../decisions/0011-prompt-presentation-contract.md).
The contract in one line: **the payload is complete, and elision is a property of a render, never of the payload**.

A gate emits structured facts rather than a sentence.
The payload's `request` group — requester and forwarded-ness, tool name and invoked tool name, gate surface and matched rule, the decision-relevant value, and for bash the unit that will actually run — is never elided by any renderer.
`evidence` is complete on the payload and elided to fit each renderer's budget, with the elision marked but uncounted; an operator must still be able to reach the complete information while the decision is pending.
The dialog is bounded by a row budget plus a per-field width cap, the review log by its own configured limits, and the `permissions:ui_prompt` broadcast receives the `request` facts only — the narrowest renderer, because the bus is the one channel an extension observes without the operator having named it.
Denial text is a fifth render of the same facts under one extra rule: it identifies the call rather than reproducing it, since the agent already holds its own tool input.

The payload exists, and the human-facing renderers are bounded.
Every gate emits a `PromptPayload` (`src/presentation/`), and `PromptPermissionDetails` requires one, so the six former assembly sites are gone.
`renderPromptDialog` renders it for the inline dialog and the `select`/`input` fallback under `promptMaxRows` plus `promptFieldMaxWidth`, and `Ctrl+O` expands the dialog to the complete request.
The cap applies to the `request` facts too: never elided means never *omitted* — a long one is shortened, marked, and reachable in full rather than dropped.
Without that reading a bounded render is unreachable, since the decision-relevant value is itself the pathological field in the reported case ([#710]).
A fact an adjacent line already states is not repeated — a bash ask's gate surface is its tool name, and a path ask's is the word its value line is labelled with — so the render spends a line only where it adds something.
That is a redundancy rule, not an elision: the fact is still on screen, which is what §3 requires.

The two cross-boundary contracts now carry facts rather than prose.
The forwarded-request wire carries the child's `PromptPayload`, so the serving node renders the child's own facts under the *parent's* budget — a forwarded bash ask reads `command : …` exactly as a local one does, and `kind: "forwarded"` narrows to meaning one thing: this ask arrived without a payload.
`permissions:ui_prompt` carries `request`, the payload's invariant core, and no evidence at all, which makes the bus the narrowest renderer (ADR 0011 §6): any loaded extension observes it without the operator having named that extension.
`toolInputPreviewMaxLength` and `toolTextSummaryMaxLength` are deprecated and ignored, superseded by the renderer budgets.

The last two consumers are renderers too, so the flat `message` string is gone.
The agent-facing text identifies a refused call rather than reproducing it (§7): it names the surface, the tool, the rule with its nested context, the flagged path or target or skill, and the operator's or human's reason — never the bash command, which is the payload that took over the viewport in [#710] and the agent's context window on every denial.
The flagged element is agent input, so it is capped rather than structurally bounded; naming it is what makes a denial correctable, since which of a call's operands a rule fired on is below tool-call granularity and the agent cannot recover it from its own arguments.
The review log persists the payload's request facts rather than the prompt sentence — stamped by `GateRunner` beside the request id, so no gate can forget them — and every string it writes is narrowed to `reviewLogFieldMaxWidth`.
That bound lives in `writeLine` beside the key-name mask, which makes the log's growth a decision the operator makes rather than a consequence of how long a command happened to be.
ADR 0011 records what each dependent item becomes under the contract.

## Two-phase checking

### Phase 1: Tool filtering (`before_agent_start`)

`shouldExposeTool` (`src/handlers/before-agent-start.ts`) asks `isToolFullyDenied(toolName)` and exposes the tool unless every value under its surface resolves to `deny` — "could *anything* this tool does get through?"

The answer comes from `isSurfaceFullyDenied` (`src/rule.ts`), which probes each pattern configured on the surface (plus the catch-all) as a representative value through the same `evaluate()`.
Ordering is therefore honored: `bash: {"*": "deny", "git *": "ask"}` keeps the tool visible, while `bash: {"git *": "ask", "*": "deny"}` does not — the later catch-all shadows the exception, so nothing is reachable.
Asking the catch-all alone (`evaluate(toolName, "*", rules)`) withheld the tool in the first case too, which is the [#815] defect.
The probe is an approximation of "does any string resolve non-deny", and being wrong in either direction only changes visibility: Phase 2 re-evaluates the real value against the same ruleset.

### Phase 2: Invocation gating (`tool_call`)

The gate pipeline (`src/handlers/gates/`) normalizes the input to `(surface, value)`, evaluates it against the composed ruleset, and acts on the result: `allow` proceeds, `deny` blocks, and `ask` elicits from the session's `Authorizer` — a persisted "session" decision appends a `Rule` to `sessionRules` so the next similar call is a cache hit.

Same `evaluate()`, same ruleset.
The only surface-specific logic is input normalization (what `surface` and `value` to look up) and pattern suggestion (what glob to offer for "session" approval).

`checkPermission()` uses a single evaluate path: `normalizeInput()` → `evaluateFirst()` → `deriveSource()` → single result object.

## Subagent detection and permission forwarding

When `ask`-state permissions arise in a headless subagent child process, the extension forwards the dialog to the parent session rather than silently denying.
This requires two detections:

1. **Is the current process a subagent?**
   - `isSubagentExecutionContext()` in `src/authority/subagent-context.ts`.
2. **What is the parent session ID?**
   - `resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId()` in `src/authority/permission-forwarding.ts`.

### Known extension env var inventory

| Extension                                                                           | Child-process env vars                                                                    | Parent-session env var              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

| pi-agent-router (original)                                                          | `PI_IS_SUBAGENT`, `PI_SUBAGENT_SESSION_ID`, `PI_AGENT_ROUTER_SUBAGENT`                    | `PI_AGENT_ROUTER_PARENT_SESSION_ID` |

### Detection (`isSubagentExecutionContext`)

`isSubagentExecutionContext()` checks three sources in priority order:

1. **Explicit registry** - the in-process half of the subagent adapter convention ([Subagent Integration](../subagent-integration.md#the-subagent-adapter-convention) is its canonical spec); the permission system's subscriber writes the entry into `SubagentSessionRegistry` synchronously.
   The registry (keyed by **child session id**) is checked first.
   Each concurrent sibling child of the same parent receives a unique session id from `sessionManager.newSession()`, so siblings occupy distinct keys - one sibling's `disposed` event cannot evict another's entry (fixes #298).
   The registry is a process-global singleton (via `getSubagentSessionRegistry()`, backed by `globalThis` + `Symbol.for()`) because each session's `ResourceLoader` creates its own `pi.events` bus: the parent's instance registers the child over the parent bus, while the child's separate jiti instance reads the same global store to detect itself and resolve its forwarding target.
2. **Env vars** (`SUBAGENT_ENV_HINT_KEYS`) - returns `true` when any key is set to a non-empty, non-whitespace value.
   Used by process-based subagent extensions.
   The list is composed from the per-extension markers plus `SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION_ENV_CANDIDATES`, since a process that names a parent session is a child by definition - which is what makes the convention's single out-of-process obligation sufficient on its own (#789).
3. **Filesystem path** - session-directory path-based fallback (child session dir is nested under `subagentSessionsDir`).

### Parent-session resolution (`resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId`)

`resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId()` checks two sources in priority order:

1. **Explicit registry** - if the caller provides a `sessionId` and `registry`, the registry entry's `parentSessionId` is returned when present.
   Used by in-process subagent extensions.
2. **Env vars** (`SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION_ENV_CANDIDATES`) - iterates candidates and returns the first non-empty, non-`"unknown"` value.
   Used by process-based subagent extensions.

Neither nicobailon nor HazAT sets a parent-session env var today, so forwarding still fails for those extensions with an explicit log message pointing to #98.
Adding a new env var candidate when an extension adopts the convention is a one-line change to the array.

### In-process case (resolved)

In-process subagent extensions (e.g. `@gotgenes/pi-subagents`) call `createAgentSession()` directly - no child process is spawned and no env vars are ever set.
The announcement they owe, and the pre-bind ordering that makes it usable, are specified by the adapter convention in [Subagent Integration](../subagent-integration.md#the-subagent-adapter-convention); `src/authority/subagent-lifecycle-events.ts` subscribes and writes/removes the entry in `SubagentSessionRegistry` synchronously.
The registry is process-global (see `getSubagentSessionRegistry()` in `src/authority/subagent-registry.ts`) so the child's separate jiti instance reads the same store as the parent.

### External convention guide

A [permission frontmatter convention guide](../guides/permission-frontmatter-for-subagent-extensions.md) documents how upstream subagent extensions can adopt the `permission:` frontmatter key as a shared convention.
This is a documentation-only proposal - no code dependency is required.
The guide covers the two-layer model, flat format reference, composition examples, and the optional event bus runtime integration.

## Cross-extension service accessor

The primary cross-extension API is a `Symbol.for()`-backed service object on `globalThis`.
The cross-node contract governing this surface is settled in [ADR 0012](../decisions/0012-cross-node-extension-contract.md); its decisions 2, 3, and 4 are implemented here.

Pi's extension loader creates a fresh jiti instance per extension with `moduleCache: false`, isolating module-scoped state.
`Symbol.for()` and `globalThis` are process-global by spec, so they survive this isolation.

One process can host several **nodes** — one Pi session runtime each, with its own `ExtensionContext`, event bus, gates, registries, and `PermissionSession`.
A root session and each of its in-process subagent children are separate nodes, and each loads its own instance of this extension.
Registrations never cross a node boundary: a child fixes an ask's facts and runs its own gates, so the extractors and formatters it needs are the ones registered in *its* registries, and chain links are consulted only by the node that adjudicates (ADR 0007 §7).

So each node publishes its `PermissionsService` at `session_start` into a process-global map keyed by its own session id, and a consumer resolves it with `getPermissionsService(sessionId)`.
The session id travels as data on the `permissions:ready` payload, alongside `adjudicatesLocally` — a registrant needs no branch on the latter, since a link registered where no chain runs is accepted and recorded rather than refused (decision 4, `authorizer_link_vacant` in the review log).
That payload is broadcast twice per session generation: at `session_start` after the node publishes, and again at the node's first `before_agent_start`, which runs after every extension's `session_start` and before any ask (decision 3, the ready latch).
So the channel fires at least once per session and may repeat, and the ready handler alone is a sufficient registration site — a consumer needs no second attempt from its own `session_start`, only an idempotence guard.
The keyed map is the only slot.
A legacy single slot, written by every node that was not an in-process subagent child (the #302 guard) and read by a deprecated `getRootPermissionsService()`, was removed once its last downstream migrated — it answered "the process root's service", which is the wrong node in every node but the root, and keyed publication dissolves the clobbering hazard the guard existed for.
The locator's `sessionId` is required rather than optional, so a `PermissionsReadyEvent.sessionId` of `null` cannot fall through to some other node; a caller the types cannot reach (JavaScript, or a consumer compiled against an earlier major) gets `undefined` plus a once-guarded `PI_PERMISSION_SYSTEM_WARN0001` warning rather than another node's service.
The `package.json` `exports` field's `default` condition points to `src/service.ts`, which contains the interface, the accessor functions, and the `Symbol.for()` key - no extension machinery.
The `types` condition instead resolves to a bundled `dist/public.d.ts` (built by `rollup-plugin-dts` from `rollup.dts.config.mjs`, published via `prepack`) so a downstream consumer's `tsc` never follows the raw `#src/*` module graph - only the `default` condition (the jiti runtime) reads `src/` directly (#592).

Both accessors come from `import("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system")`.
The `PermissionsService` interface exposes six methods:

- `checkPermission(surface, value?, agentName?)` - full policy query.
- `getToolPermission(toolName, agentName?)` - the surface's catch-all permission state (`allow`/`deny`/`ask`).
- `isToolFullyDenied(toolName, agentName?)` - whether every value under the surface resolves to `deny`; the question tool pre-filtering asks, since a partially permissive surface reports `deny` from the catch-all.
- `registerToolInputFormatter(toolName, formatter)` - register a custom ask-prompt preview for a tool name; returns a disposer (#283).
- `registerToolAccessExtractor(toolName, extractor)` - declare the filesystem path a non-conventional tool accesses, so the cross-cutting `path`/`external_directory` gates see it; returns a disposer (#352).
- `registerAuthorizer(name, authorize)` - register a named live-authority chain link (`allow | deny | defer`, ADR 0007 §4); decides nothing until the operator names it in `authorizerChain` config, and every verdict is capped by the bounded-delegation checkpoint; returns a disposer.

`permissions:decision` and `permissions:ui_prompt` broadcasts remain on the event bus - fire-and-forget observation is the right abstraction for those channels ([#531] removed the event-bus RPC channel; the service accessor is now the sole cross-extension policy/prompt surface).

## The authority model

This section records the organizing concept the package is built around — the spine the elicitation, forwarding, and yolo machinery collapse into — plus the still-open directions that extend it.
It is current state, not a target: the `Authorizer` interface, its three implementations, once-per-activation selection, `canConfirm()`'s dissolution, serving-as-resolution, human-selectable grant-scope, and the `authority/` directory migration all shipped in Phase 9 (see [history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md](history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md) for why the spine is the correct model of the `@gotgenes/pi-subagents` integration — the anonymous cross-session-authority recursion behind the [#296]/[#298]/[#302] bug history — and not merely an internal tidy).
Of the ["beyond the target"](#beyond-the-target-a-non-deterministic-access-intent-classifier) extension points below, the model-triage `Authorizer` chain is now implemented (Phase 12; [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md)), and its named-link registration subsumes the pluggable escalation seam; the deny-first slice is dogfooded by `packages/pi-permission-model-judge`, and the allow-capable opaque-bash adjudicator ([#620]) remains the sole open Track B slice.
A non-deterministic access-intent classifier remains aspirational.

### The spine

Every action resolves against an **authority** — an entity empowered to permit or forbid it.
The only questions are *which* authority and how we reach it.

This sharpens principle 8.
That principle calls the human "the oracle," borrowing the computer-science term for a black box consulted for an answer the system cannot compute.
But a permission decision is not epistemic (who *knows* the answer); it is deontic (who has the *right* to decide).
If a bystander happened to know what the user wanted, their saying "allow" would authorize nothing.
What makes a decision binding is authority, not knowledge — so the organizing concept is authority, and the entity that holds it is an **`Authorizer`**.
The human is merely the `Authorizer` at the interactive root; another agent can hold the role equally well.

### Authority lives in three places

1. **Recorded authority** — the ruleset.
   Config (durable, on disk), session rules (this session), and synthesized defaults/baseline are all prior rulings.
   `evaluate()` *is* "consult recorded authority": an `allow` or `deny` means recorded authority is sufficient, and the decision is final.
2. **Live authority** — reached only on `ask`, when recorded authority is silent.
   An entity empowered to rule *now*, reached through one of three channels (below).
3. **Absent authority** — nothing recorded, nothing reachable.
   Least privilege applies: no authority means the action is unauthorized, so it is denied.

The three are one thing at different lifetimes.
A live ruling, once persisted, *becomes* recorded authority — principle 8's "their decision is a rule."
The "for this session" dialog option writes a session rule; a future "always" writes config.

### The `Authorizer` role

On `ask`, the gate escalates to **one `Authorizer`, selected once per session from context**, and is told the decision.

1. **`LocalUserAuthorizer`** — the session has UI; prompt the human here.
2. **`ParentAuthorizer`** — the session is a subagent; escalate up the tree to the parent's authority.
3. **`DenyingAuthorizer`** — no authority is reachable; deny (least privilege).

There is no "can anyone answer" pre-check.
`canConfirm()` — today a boolean smeared across the gateway, prompter, and forwarder — dissolves: every `Authorizer` answers, the `DenyingAuthorizer` by denying.
The three context predicates (`hasUI`, `isSubagent`, yolo) are evaluated once, at selection, instead of repeatedly down the prompt path.

```text
evaluate(action, recorded authority)
  ├─ allow / deny ------------------> decided (recorded authority sufficient)
  └─ ask (recorded authority silent)
        └─ escalate to the session's Authorizer
              ├─ LocalUserAuthorizer -> prompt the human here
              ├─ ParentAuthorizer    -> forward up the tree, await the parent's ruling
              └─ DenyingAuthorizer    -> deny (no authority reachable)
                    |
              (a persisted ruling becomes recorded authority)
```

### The recursion

Authority is delegated **down** the session tree: the human drives the root, which spawns subagents that hold no inherent authority to approve a novel action.
So an `ask` a subagent cannot answer **escalates up** to where authority resides.
Permission-system instances form a tree mirroring the session tree, and `ParentAuthorizer` is the edge that routes a child's escalation toward the human at the root.
This is the same recursion pi-subagents describes (a subagent is a child Pi), viewed from the permission system's side: the package is itself one of the hooks on that child, and it recurses by forwarding.

### Reconstruction fidelity at the serving node

The courier hop carries facts, not judgment — but what the serving node reconstructs from a forwarded request differs by audience, and the two directions are the same rule applied to different trust boundaries.

An **in-process seam** — the `Authorizer` chain, reached through `PromptPermissionDetails` — receives the full child-fixed fact set.
A chain link is operator-opted-in via `authorizerChain` and must decide from evidence, not from parsed display text or a parent-side re-derivation of the child's path ([ADR 0008](../decisions/0008-cross-session-access-intent.md) forbids the latter outright).
The bounded-delegation checkpoint reads the same facts, so a forwarded ask is capped on the gate surface exactly as a local one is ([ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md) §5).

A **cross-extension broadcast** — `permissions:ui_prompt` / `permissions:decision` on `pi.events` — receives the minimum needed to stay correlatable, because any loaded extension can observe it.

Maximum fidelity to the decider; minimum disclosure to the observer.
Requester identity (`requesterCwd`, `principal`) crosses to neither: it is the serving node's own resolution input (ADR 0008 §3) and stays on the wire object, with the ask details carrying only the `forwarding` provenance.

### yolo is recorded authority

yolo is not a channel and not a live concern — it is a standing authorization, and it belongs in the ruleset, not in the prompt path.
It is a composition-stage rewrite: when enabled, every `ask` action in the composed ruleset is rewritten to `allow`, tagged `origin: "yolo"` so the review log still distinguishes a yolo grant from a policy allow.

```typescript
const effective = yolo
  ? composed.map((r) => (r.action === "ask" ? { ...r, action: "allow", origin: "yolo" } : r))
  : composed;
```

This is faithful to current behavior exactly: explicit `deny` rules are not `ask`, so they pass through untouched — yolo suppresses prompts but **preserves hard denies**.
It honors principle 5 (defaults are rules; no side-channel fallbacks): `evaluate()` runs pure over the rewritten ruleset, and the prompt path loses all yolo knowledge (`shouldAutoApprovePermissionState` and `canResolveAskPermissionRequest`'s yolo arm dissolve).

The ruleset is the whole story for asks the ruleset produces.
An `ask` synthesized *after* resolution is not one: the bash wrapper floor (#481, #490) and the fail-closed `<unparseable-bash-command>` sentinel (#452) are properties of a parsed command unit, not of a pattern, so there is no rule for the rewrite to touch and they reached the prompter under yolo (#712).
A wrapper the floor no longer covers (#803) synthesizes nothing, so it never reaches that reconciliation at all — it is decided by an ordinary rule, on the inner command's text.
The reconciliation has exactly one home — `resolveYoloGrant` at `GateRunner`'s auto-approve fast path, the single choke point every gate passes through before escalating — so the contract "an `ask` never reaches `PermissionPrompter` under yolo" holds structurally for whatever floor is added next.
It is the same deny-preserving shape as the rewrite: a `deny` is not an `ask`, so it matches neither arm.
A future "disable everything" mode — overriding denies too — would be a *different*, deliberately named operation: appending a final `{ surface: "*", pattern: "*", action: "allow" }` rule (last-match-wins).
It is not built, and it would be requested by name, never conflated with yolo.

### Fail-closed on an invalid non-global scope

The mirror image of the yolo rewrite.
When a non-global config scope (project, agent, or project-agent) is present but fails to load or validate, the loader marks it invalid (`ScopeConfig.invalid`) instead of silently substituting an empty scope.
At composition the manager floors every `allow` in the composed ruleset to `ask`, tagged `origin: "fail-closed"`, so a permissive rule inherited from a lower-precedence scope cannot remain effective behind a higher scope that was meant to tighten it (#646).

```typescript
const effective =
  failClosedScopes.length > 0
    ? composed.map((r) => (r.action === "allow" ? { ...r, action: "ask", origin: "fail-closed" } : r))
    : composed;
```

Like yolo it is deny-preserving (only `allow` is touched) and applied at composition, so the display surfaces (`getComposedConfigRules`, `getToolPermission`) reflect the clamp too.
Global is excluded — it is the lowest precedence, so nothing more permissive is inherited when it fails.
The two overlays stack in order: fail-closed floors `allow`→`ask` first, then yolo (if enabled) rewrites `ask`→`allow`, so an explicit yolo opt-in still wins.

### Discriminating delegation: a model `Authorizer`

Nothing constrains an `Authorizer` to be deterministic.
`LocalUserAuthorizer` is already a non-deterministic oracle — the human — and the determinism principle governs *recorded* authority (`evaluate()`), never the live-authority layer.
A model (e.g. Claude Haiku) can hold an `Authorizer` role on the same terms: it is live authority, so it never touches `evaluate()` or the deterministic core.

The design is settled in [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md); the essentials follow.

**The live-authority layer is a Chain of Responsibility.**
Each link returns `allow | deny | defer`; on `defer` the next link decides.
The chain ends at a **terminal that cannot defer** — today the human (`LocalUserAuthorizer`), the headless `DenyingAuthorizer`, or `ParentAuthorizer` (terminal for its node, forwarding up to the parent node's chain — the [recursion](#the-recursion) above).
The invariant is type-level: a terminal returns only `allow | deny`, so a deferring link cannot occupy the terminal slot.
`selectAuthorizer` becomes the terminal-selection step of `composeAuthorizerChain` — registered non-terminal links, then the context-selected terminal.

**One chain per node.**
An ask is adjudicated by exactly one node's chain: the node whose terminal decides it (ADR 0007 §7).
A subagent node's terminal relays the ask to a serving node, which escalates it through *its* chain over the same child-fixed facts — so a relaying node resolves no links, and records `authorizer_chain_delegated` rather than reporting each configured name as a fail-safe skip.
An adjudicating node records `authorizer_chain_resolved` with the names it consulted, since a deferring link decides nothing and otherwise leaves no evidence it ran.

```text
ask -> [ model-judge link ] --defer--> … --defer--> [ terminal: human | Parent | Denying ]
              ├─ deny (with teaching reason)   -> denied
              ├─ allow (slice 2, if not excluded) -> permitted
              └─ defer                          -> next link
```

**The model judge is a non-terminal link**, not a decorator or a fourth channel.
It reviews an `ask`, decides the ones it is confident about, and defers the rest to its successor — a middle rung between prompt-everything and allow-everything.
Denies are decided by recorded authority and structurally never reach an `Authorizer`, so a model link cannot grant a hard deny; the safeguard for a sensitive resource stays an explicit `deny` rule, which survives the model just as it survives the yolo rewrite.

The verdict range is `allow | deny | defer` — a superset of the earlier allow-or-escalate framing — because the first use case is **deny-first**.
A light model reviews `external_directory` asks, denies an errant "typo" path with a teaching `reason` (wrong path; correct location) so the invoking model self-corrects, and defers everything else.
A second use case adjudicates **opaque bash**: the model decomposes a `bash -c "…"` / `eval` command and queries the deterministic engine per sub-command through an injected, narrow `PermissionQuery` (never a reach-through to `PermissionsService`), allowing only what the engine already grants for the pieces it identifies.
The two are one link on a **capability gradient**: the deny/defer reviewer is strictly more restrictive and ships first; the allow-capable adjudicator loosens privilege and is gated behind the full envelope (hard exclusions, audit `origin: "authorizer:model"`, non-persistence, off by default), because its safety property holds only if the model's decomposition is faithful.

Registration mirrors `registerToolAccessExtractor`: a downstream extension offers a **named** capability (`registerAuthorizer("model-judge", …)`) on `permissions:ready`, and this package makes no LLM call itself.
Three invariants govern the seam: config order (not registration order) fixes the security-relevant chain order; a missing configured link is skipped fail-safe (more prompting, never less); and **registration alone grants no authority** — a link decides nothing until the operator names it in the `authorizerChain` config (opt-in).
Bounded delegation is operator config this package enforces at a checkpoint that downgrades an excluded-surface `allow` to `defer`, with `external_directory` and secret-shaped `path` always excluded; the model's provider/prompt/threshold live in the downstream extension's own config.

This is the principled successor to the per-command argument-position work deferred from [#509].
The bash path projection surfaces a bare token that names a real file ([#645]) and deliberately accepts a fail-safe false positive (`grep id_rsa secrets.txt` prompts when an `id_rsa` file happens to exist); that false positive lives on the *ask-producing* side of `evaluate()`, and the model link dismisses it on the *ask-consuming* side without hard-coding per-command file-argument tables.
This split is the layering principle of [ADR 0009](../decisions/0009-bash-path-projection-completeness-contract.md): the deterministic layer biases toward surfacing because over-suppression is unrecoverable, and the judge absorbs the surplus.
The two compose cleanly because a promoted token emits the same structured descriptor a prefixed path does, so a link needs no promotion-specific knowledge.

**Dogfooded:** a first-party monorepo package (`packages/pi-permission-model-judge`) implements the deny-first typo-path reviewer against the real seam, so `registerAuthorizer` is born consumed (the [#267] vacant-surface guard).

### Resolved direction

These were the open decisions; they are now settled and shipped (full rationale in [history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md](history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md)).

1. **Serving is resolution.**
   A serving node runs `evaluate()` against its recorded authority then escalates to its own `Authorizer` on `ask`, carrying the forwarded ask's provenance as data so the `permissions:ui_prompt` broadcast stays non-degraded.
2. **Multi-level escalation: admitted, not shipped.**
   A middle node's chain terminates in a `ParentAuthorizer`, so re-escalation needs no special-casing; the tree is depth-2 today (pi-subagents' recursion guard), and a one-hop canary flags any future break.
3. **Full delegation of authority down the tree.**
   A subagent inherits its ancestors' `allow`/`deny` rules and yolo; because yolo is deny-preserving, the safeguard for a cheaper delegate is an explicit `deny` in its per-agent frontmatter, not an `ask`.
4. **Grant scope is human-selectable.**
   Approving a forwarded request "for this session" offers root / parent / requesting-subagent scope (requesting subagent pre-selected); "parent" and "root" coincide until trees deepen.

### Remaining design work

**Access-intent extraction** is the one genuinely open piece, and the foundation for the path surface of the decisions above.
The package's center of mass is not the decision engine (tiny, pure) but turning `(toolName, input)` into "what is being accessed" — bash decomposition, MCP target derivation, path extraction, external-directory detection.
This is a distinct domain (access intent) that gates should *emit* and a single `resolve(intent)` should answer, so adding a gate cannot widen the resolver surface.
The [#393] false-green (a stubbed-but-unrouted resolver method silently passing `allow`) was the probe pointing at it: the resolver surface was `resolve` + `resolvePathPolicy`, widening per gate, until Phase 6 Step 6 ([#478]) collapsed it to one `resolve(intent)`.
[#418] is a second probe, from the access-path side: both external-directory gates matched config patterns against the symlink-resolved path because a single `string` carries a path that is simultaneously a containment value (canonical, for the outside-CWD boundary) and a match value (lexical, as the user typed it), with no type distinction — so the canonical form leaked into matching and defeated a configured `/tmp/*` allow.
The same conflation lived in `BashProgram.externalPaths(): string[]`, which returned only the canonical form and so lost the typed value the matcher needed.
The fix's `getExternalDirectoryPolicyValues` helper (the union of lexical aliases and the canonical path) was the embryo of the access-path: `AccessPath` ([#476]) now holds both forms behind distinct `matchValues()` and boundary accessors, making the misuse a compile error; `BashProgram.externalPaths()` now returns `AccessPath[]` and one external-directory policy check can replace the two parallel gates that independently acquired this bug.
The tractable first slice was the access-path value object seeded by [#418]: it removed the path-representation conflation and the duplicate external-directory gate without waiting on principal identity or cross-session portability.
Principal identity and path portability across cwds — a subagent in a `pi-subagents-worktrees` worktree resolves paths against a different root than the parent — are now settled: [ADR 0008](../decisions/0008-cross-session-access-intent.md) (Phase 12) fixes a path-shaped ask's portable meaning at the child (the child's lexical ∪ canonical `matchValues()` plus canonical `boundaryValue()`), carries it onto the forwarded wire as `ForwardedAccessIntent`, and makes serving agent-scoped (`requesterAgentName` decision-participating).
A forwarded ask now resolves against the child-fixed alias set rather than a re-derivation through the parent's `PathNormalizer`/cwd.
With principal identity and path portability delivered, this domain has no further genuinely open piece; a non-path serving refinement (a per-surface `Authorizer` chain exclusion beyond `external_directory`/secret-shaped `path`) remains a candidate but is not scheduled.

### Beyond the target: a non-deterministic access-intent classifier

This is a **more distant** direction than the target above — noted as a candidate extension point, not planned work.

Access-intent extraction is deterministic by design: `(toolName, input)` becomes "what is being accessed" through bash decomposition, MCP target derivation, and path rules.
A second, independent place non-determinism could one day enter is a model that *classifies* access intent **before** `evaluate()` — deciding, for instance, that `id_rsa` in `git grep id_rsa` is a search pattern rather than a file, so no path candidate is emitted at all.

The classifier differs from the [`ModelTriageAuthorizer`](#discriminating-delegation-a-model-authorizer) in *where the model sits*.
The classifier feeds **recorded** authority — it shapes the intent `evaluate()` rules on — whereas the Authorizer holds **live** authority and answers the `ask`.
A wrong classifier call is a misread of what is being accessed; a wrong Authorizer call is a mis-granted decision.
Because the classifier changes the *input* to the deterministic core, it weakens the "same `(toolName, input)` yields the same ruling" property more subtly than the Authorizer does — the model output becomes part of the intent — so it warrants its own decision record and is deliberately out of scope for the current target.
The access-intent domain the gates emit into is the natural seam for such a pluggable classifier: deterministic today, model-assisted only if and when that trade is made by name.

### Beyond the target: a pluggable escalation seam

The **registration seam** this section anticipated is now designed: [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md) settles the `Authorizer` chain and its named-link registration (`registerAuthorizer`), with the model judge as its first consumer.
What remains a **more distant** direction — a candidate extension point, not planned work — is applying that same seam to *replace the terminal* (a delegation framework other than pi-subagents, a chat-approval bot, or a remote review surface *as* the authority) and refactoring the built-in subagent integration to register through it.

The [#261]/[#267] inversion made pi-subagents pure — it publishes its child lifecycle and knows nothing about consumers ([ADR-0002]) — but the purity is one-sided: this package is the integration owner.
It knows pi-subagents' event channel names (`subagent-lifecycle-events.ts`), hardcodes an env-hint inventory of known third-party subagent extensions (`SUBAGENT_ENV_HINT_KEYS`), and bakes in a session-directory heuristic.
Supporting a new delegation framework — or something that is not a subagent extension at all, such as a chat-approval bot or a remote review surface — means editing this package.

The subagent machinery decomposes into three roles a seam would name and separate:

- **Detection** — is this session a delegated context?
  This is an Authorizer-selection predicate; [#529]'s `SubagentDetection` gives it one owner.
- **Target resolution** — where does authority live for this session; which node serves the escalation (`resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId` today).
- **Transport** — how an `ask` travels to that authority and the ruling returns (the file-based request/response polling today; [#530]'s escalation-up role, `ParentAuthorizer` since [#555]).

A registered provider is exactly a selection predicate plus a `ParentAuthorizer`-shaped transport: "when my predicate matches this session and recorded authority is silent, escalate through me."
The `Authorizer` spine is therefore the seam — this direction is the spine's registration story, not a mechanism beside it.

Two shapes, the second generalizing the first:

1. **A bridge extension** — a third package subscribes to pi-subagents' lifecycle and registers with this package's public seam, leaving both cores pure.
   A dedicated glue extension knowing both ends is the sanctioned complement of the rule against outbound bridges *from a core*.
2. **A dogfooded provider seam** — this package defines the registration API and implements its own built-in pi-subagents integration through it, the way `registerToolAccessExtractor` / `registerToolInputFormatter` already let extensions plug the gates; third parties register on equal terms and the zero-config default survives.

A history guard: this re-introduces an inbound registration surface of the kind [#267] retired.
It differs in kind — consumer-agnostic, documented for third parties, and consumed by the built-in provider itself, so it cannot go vacant the way the two-method `registerSubagentSession` RPC did.

Any design must honor the standing constraints: registration lands synchronously before `bindExtensions()`; cross-session visibility rides `globalThis` + `Symbol.for()` (the [#296] bus-split lesson); a provider is live authority only and never touches `evaluate()`; and a session no provider claims selects `DenyingAuthorizer` — least privilege, unchanged.
It sequences after the Phase 9 spine and warrants its own decision record.

### Naming

The concept and the code role take two grammatical forms of one root, each for what it correctly denotes:

- **`authority`** (mass noun) — the right to decide; used for the concept ("recorded authority," "where authority lives").
- **`Authorizer`** (count noun) — the entity that holds it; used for the interface and its implementations.

`Authorizer` is domain-idiomatic: AWS Lambda "authorizers" and OAuth's authorization server return allow/deny, so the term already denotes an entity that can refuse.

## Module structure

```text
src/
├── rule.ts                   Rule type, Ruleset type, evaluate() (takes an injected `PathFlavor` for win32 path-surface case-folding); exports `pathMatchOptions(surface, flavor)` and `isSurfaceFullyDenied(surface, rules, flavor)`, the reachability probe tool exposure asks (each configured pattern probed through evaluate, so last-match-wins shadowing is honored)
├── normalize.ts              Config → Ruleset normalization (flat format); `expandDirectionalSugar` rewrites a scope's bare `path` / `external_directory` key into its directional members before composition, sugar entries first and explicit directional entries appended after, whatever the file's key order. Constraint: no rule survives on a bare family surface — the resolver's family fold is the read path (ADR 0013 §4)
├── synthesize.ts             Universal default + MCP baseline → Ruleset
├── wildcard-matcher.ts       Compiled glob matching. `CompiledWildcardPattern.matches(value)` is the only match surface (no exposed `RegExp`). Constraint: the win32 `windowsSeparators` fold applies to the pattern and the matched value alike, and lives on the compiled pattern so it cannot be half-applied — folding only the pattern makes every forward-slash value unmatchable (#653)
├── pattern-suggest.ts        Per-surface approval pattern suggestions: `suggestSessionPattern` for a surface's own value vocabulary (bash command, MCP target, skill name), `suggestPathSessionPattern` for a pattern the caller's `PathNormalizer` already derived. Also the dialog's label vocabulary: `describeGrantTarget` names what an approval covers (one pattern, or a count), `buildDirectionalSessionLabels` labels the two direction widths, `buildForwardedScopeLabels` labels the forwarded scope step. Constraint: holds no path-language semantics — a path pattern arrives derived and is labelled verbatim. The forwarded scope label names the grants' shared *family*, never a directional member: it is built before the dialog runs, so a direction there could contradict a width chosen inside it
├── bash-arity.ts             Command arity table for bash pattern suggestions
├── expand-home.ts            `expandHomePath`: `~` / `$HOME` / `${HOME}` expansion for patterns and path values, over one prefix table so the three spellings cannot drift; a prefix is recognized only standalone or before a separator, so `~username` / `$HOMEDIR` / `${HOME:-/tmp}` are left alone
├── approval-grant.ts         `ApprovalGrant` interface - one pattern paired with the surface it was approved on - plus the `SessionGrantWidth` vocabulary over it: `widenGrant` folds a grant to its family, `provenDirectionOf` answers whether one direction describes a whole approval, `isSessionGrantWidth` guards the value off the forwarded wire. Its own module because both `session-approval.ts` and the forwarded wire type name it, and those two already import in one direction
├── session-approval.ts        SessionApproval value object - owns a list of `ApprovalGrant`s, built by `single` or `forGrants`; exposes `isRecordable`, `toForwardedData()`, and `atWidth(width)`, which produces the approval as recorded at a chosen width so the runner never inspects a grant's surface
├── session-rules.ts          Session approval store (Ruleset wrapper); records each grant on the surface that grant names, so an ask whose paths proved different directions grants each only its own; `implements SessionApprovalRecorder`; injected into `GateRunner` as the recorder role
├── policy-loader.ts          PolicyLoader interface + FilePolicyLoader (file I/O, mtime caching); marks a present-but-unloadable non-global scope `invalid` (an absent file stays a plain empty scope) so composition can fail closed
├── scope-merge.ts            Cross-scope permission merge + origin-map bookkeeping
├── permission-manager.ts     Scope loading + rule composition + `check(intent)` (single resolution entry point); delegates I/O to PolicyLoader; floors the composed ruleset `allow`→`ask` (origin `fail-closed`) when a non-global scope is `invalid`, and appends a fail-closed notice to `getConfigIssues`. Constraint: stays string-based — must not import `AccessPath` (the ADR 0002 string boundary, lint-guarded by `no-restricted-imports`)
├── permission-gate.ts        Pure deny/ask/allow gate (injected IO). Reports a whole-session grant as one optional field (`canGrantForSession` in, `sessionGrant` out) rather than echoing the suggestion, which the caller already holds and which has no single representative once an approval carries a surface per pattern. The field carries the width to record at rather than sitting beside a separate flag, so a width for a grant that never happened is unrepresentable. Both result arms carry the `DecisionSource` that answered — the gate is the one place that knows whether recorded authority or an escalation decided, so the caller reads it rather than reconstructing it from a captured decision. Its `messages` bag holds one refusal factory, not one per outcome: which sentence a refusal earns follows from the decision's own decider, dispatched at the renderer
├── restrictiveness.ts        The deny > ask > allow ordering, first-wins on ties: `mostRestrictiveOf` over a statically non-empty tuple (total, so the resolver's family fold has no `undefined` branch) and the empty-tolerant `pickMostRestrictive` the bash gates use. Core-layer, so `permission-resolver.ts` can depend on it
├── permission-resolver.ts    `ScopedPermissionResolver` interface - the single `{ resolve(intent) }` role the gate factories / runner / pipeline depend on; `PermissionResolver` concrete class holds `ScopedPermissionManager` + `SessionRules`, owns `resolve(intent)` (unwraps an `access-path` `AccessIntent` via `matchValues()` before calling `manager.check`; the concrete class also accepts a pre-fixed `path-values` intent as a passthrough — the forwarded-serving wire's producer, #597 — while the gate-facing interface stays narrow to `AccessIntent`), the surface-family fold (an intent naming a bare `path` / `external_directory` surface is resolved against each directional member and combined most-restrictive, returning the losing member's own result). Constraint: the fold lives here, not in the gates — this is the one entry point the gates, `LocalPermissionsService`, and `ServingPolicy` share, and a serving node resolving a forwarded child request against an emptied bare surface would stop hard-denying what the parent's config denies (#712, #806). Also owns raw `checkPermission` (`implements SkillPermissionChecker`, no session rules), `getToolPermission`, `isToolFullyDenied`, and `getConfigIssues`
├── decision-reporter.ts      `DecisionBroadcaster` (emit only) + `DecisionReporter` (extends it with the review-log write) + `GateDecisionReporter` class - owns `SessionLogger` and event bus; a collaborator that only announces an outcome depends on the narrow half
├── decision-audit.ts         `DecisionRecorder` / `DecisionSummaryWriter` / `AuditLogger` interfaces + `DecisionAudit` class - per-session decision counters; `writeSummary` emits a `permission.session_summary` debug line on shutdown and warns on a `toolCalls != allowed + blocked + errors` invariant violation
├── session-approval-recorder.ts `SessionApprovalRecorder` interface - records a granted session-scoped approval into the session ruleset; implemented by `SessionRules`
│
├── permission-session.ts     `PermissionSession` class - state/lifecycle owner: owns context lifecycle, session-rule lifecycle (`reset`/`shutdown`/`reload`), skill entries, agent-name resolution, the config gateway, the Tell-Don't-Ask gate inputs, and `notify(message)` (UI warn over the owned context, no-op before activation); `implements ToolCallGateInputs`. The resolve role lives in `PermissionResolver`, the recorder role in `SessionRules`; handlers depend on the concrete class + `PermissionResolver`
├── path-normalizer.ts        `PathNormalizer` class - the path-interpretation collaborator constructed once at the session edge with the injected `PathFlavor` (exposed as `readonly flavor`) and session `cwd` baked in; hands raw tokens, returns prepared values: `forPath`/`forLiteral` (build `AccessPath`s), `isAbsolute`/`resolveBase`/`joinBase` (flavor-aware `cd`-fold routing), `isWithinDirectory`/`isOutsideWorkingDirectory` (containment), `comparableValue` (lexical comparison for skill-prompt matching), `isInfrastructureRead`, `approvalPatternFor` (the session-approval glob for a built `AccessPath`, the sole home of that derivation), and `forBashToken`/`interpretBashCdTarget`/`isBoundaryOutsideWorkingDirectory` (Git Bash/MSYS bash-token interpretation — safe devices preserved, `/c/…` drive mounts translated, other POSIX absolutes literal-only). Also owns `entryExists` (lstat), the existence probe deciding whether a bare bash token names a real filesystem entry, kept here so path interpretation has a single filesystem edge alongside canonicalization (ADR 0009). A facade over the `path/` and `access-intent/path-normalization` primitives; holds no platform discriminator — every platform question delegates to `flavor`, so no consumer reads `process.platform` or threads `cwd`

Constraint: `ResolvedAccessIntent` (`tool | path-values`) is what the manager consumes after the resolver unwraps `access-path` via `matchValues()` — `path-values` is still not gate-emitted, keeping the manager string-based (the ADR 0002 boundary), but since #597 it has a second legitimate producer: the forwarded-serving wire builds a `path-values` intent directly from a `ForwardedAccessIntent`'s child-fixed `matchValues`, via `buildResolvedIntentFromMatchValues` (`input-normalizer.ts`)

The family relation is derived from a family set and a suffix list, so each of the four directional names is spelled exactly once, and every proof source reaches a surface by the one function

│       ├── parser.ts           Lazy tree-sitter-bash parser: `TSNode` interface (exported), `getParser = memoizeAsyncWithRetry(initParser)` (exported); `warmBashParser()` / `getWarmBashParser(): TSParser | null` / `resetWarmBashParser()` (test-only) expose the resolved parser synchronously after a `before_agent_start` warm-up so the advisory bash path can decompose at gate parity. Also owns the two readers of `TSNode`'s `hasError` / `previousSibling`: `parseUnresolvedAt(node)` (subtree or preceding sibling), because error recovery discards text it cannot attach in either place and a caller consulting only the subtree sees half the cases; and `parseUnresolvedWithin(node)` (subtree only), the question a walker descending statements asks. Constraints: no other module reads either member — recovering-parser behavior is a fact about tree-sitter rather than about any construct, and a hand-rolled sibling walk elsewhere is how the two placements drift apart again (#814); and the two are not interchangeable — the predecessor clause is a fact about redirects, so borrowing it for statements would condemn every statement following a failed one (#840)
│       ├── node-text.ts        Quote-aware AST node-text resolver: `resolveNodeText` (pure), `SKIP_SUBTREE_TYPES` (node types whose *text* is never an argument — heredoc/comment), `ARG_NODE_TYPES` (argument-value node-type set); delegates expansion nodes to `shell-variable-expansion.ts`, falling back to the node's literal text
│       ├── nested-execution.ts Shared nested-execution vocabulary for both bash surfaces: `NESTED_EXECUTION_CONTEXTS` (substitution node type → `BashCommandContext`), `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES` (node types that are not commands or argument values but whose subtree can host a command that really runs — redirects, heredoc/herestring bodies), and two traversals answering the two questions a consumer can have: `forEachNestedExecution(node, visit)` searches strictly within a subtree, while `forEachExecutionIn(node, visit)` is root-inclusive, visiting a node that *is* a context and delegating for one that merely contains one. Neither descends past a context it finds, which is what lets a visitor decide how to treat the interior. Constraint: the command surface and the path surface must share one definition of a nested execution, or a command gated on one surface escapes the other (#741)
│       ├── shell-variable-expansion.ts Pure plain-reference resolver: `resolvePlainVariableExpansion(node): string | null` — `$HOME`/`${HOME}` → `os.homedir()`, `$PWD`/`${PWD}` → `.` (the base-relative marker, so the resolver's existing `resolveBase` applies it after `cd` folding). Plainness is structural (exactly one `variable_name` child, otherwise only delimiters), so an operator form (`${HOME:-/tmp}`, `${#HOME}`) is rejected without enumerating bash's expansion operators. Constraint: the resolvable set is closed at `HOME`/`PWD` — widening it is an ADR 0009 amendment, and the expansion vocabulary lives only here, never in the classifiers
│       ├── command-effects.ts Pure word-based effect proofs, the two sources the package can hold without belief: `PURE_READER_CORE` (the frozen 21-word roster, grouped by admission reason with the deliberate exclusions recorded beside it) behind `proveCommandEffect(headWord, argWords)`, and `redirectDestinationEffect(operator, destinationIsDescriptor)` over the redirect operator table. Constraints: a core word matches as a **bare basename only** — a head word containing `/` or `\` proves nothing, rejected on the separator characters directly so the rule needs no `PathFlavor` and stays fail-closed on both platforms; `find`/`fd`/`sort` carry retraction guards matched fail-closed across the exact-word, long-stem (including a GNU abbreviation and an attached `=value`), and clustered-short forms, yielding `retracted` rather than a write; an operator outside the table proves nothing rather than returning `null`, since dropping a token removes a path from the gates entirely. Pure and word-based — the AST walk that produces the words stays in `token-collection.ts`
│       ├── token-collection.ts Bash argument/flag tokenizer: `collectPathCandidateTokens`, `collectCommandTokens`, `collectRedirectTokens`, `extractCommandName`, `extractCommandWord` (exported); private `PATTERN_FIRST_COMMANDS` table and pattern/generic collectors, plus `collectEmbeddedOptionValues` — emits the inline value of a **generic** command's `--opt=value` argument as its own token, read from the argument nodes (a collector classifies a flag and never emits it), so an option-embedded path is classified by the ordinary shape rules without per-command option tables (#645). A pattern-first command runs that split from inside its own walker instead, because there each recognized flag carries a `PatternFlagRole` — `script` / `script-file` / `value` / `suffix`, keyed by short **and** long spelling and matched exactly, `=`-embedded, or glued — which decides at once whether the inline pattern positional is spent, whether the flag's value is a path candidate, and whether the following argument belongs to the flag at all; a pending consumption discharges on whatever node type follows, and a positional is likewise spent by any node the shell passes as a word, so a number, expansion, or substitution — as a flag's argument or as the pattern itself — cannot shift the positional count onto the operand; a redirect hosted on the command node is the one exclusion, narrow on purpose because miscounting an argument as a redirect drops an operand while the reverse only over-surfaces. The table lists a flag as consuming only when it consumes on every supported platform **and in every command sharing the entry** — which is why `grep` and `rg` split on `--context` (getopt declares it optional-argument, clap does not), why `sed -i` is `suffix` (BSD takes a separate suffix argument and GNU glues it, and the argument's own emptiness decides which without detecting the host's sed), and why `awk`/`nawk`'s GNU long forms are `unknown-arity` — the bare name is GNU awk on Fedora/RHEL and one-true-awk or mawk elsewhere, so the table claims neither arity and lets both spellings' operands through rather than guessing, while `gawk` names GNU awk outright and carries the real roles. This is an active constraint, since over-listing drops a real operand while under-listing only over-surfaces (#823). Every collector returns `PathToken[]` — the token paired with the `TokenEffect` its position proved — tagged where the token is *produced*, so a nested execution's tokens keep their own command's attribution and a redirect destination carries the operator's proof over the redirected command's. `extractCommandName` basenames for the pattern-first tables while `extractCommandWord` returns the raw head word the core's bare-basename rule needs; the two are documented against each other. Also projects the operands of a command hosted in a redirect destination or an interpolating heredoc body; the `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES` dispatch sits above the `SKIP_SUBTREE_TYPES` check because `heredoc_body` is in both sets and the host reading must win — its prose stays out of the path surface while its substitution's operands enter it (#741). `COMMAND_PREFIX_TYPES` (`command_name`, `variable_assignment`) names the children that supply no operand of their own but can host a command that really runs, so both walkers collect a prefix-position substitution's operands while a prefix assignment's literal value stays out; the set exists because the two walkers are different state machines and would otherwise drift. Also reads the operands a statement names directly — a `for`/`select` word-list entry and a `case` subject — through one `collectStatementOperandTokens` walker parameterized by which side of the anonymous `in` keyword is the operand side. Constraints: a non-operand child, and an operand-side child outside `ARG_NODE_TYPES`, both fall through to the ordinary recursion rather than to a hosted-execution search — the first is what keeps a `do_group` reaching the loop body's commands, and the second is what keeps a substitution in the word list descended rather than read as literal text, so it retains its own command's effect attribution; a `case` pattern, a loop variable, and a function's own name are never read, the same boundary the command enumerator's `STATEMENT_TYPES` filter draws from the other side (#839)
│       ├── command-enumeration.ts Bash command enumerator: `collectCommands` (exported) + the descend/skip tables and the node→`CommandWord` adapter; owns the `BashCommand` interface including the `wrapperKind` discriminant, the display-only `executedUnit`, and the `floorExemption` a transparent wrapper carries; strips leading `variable_assignment` prefixes from command units. Relays a `UnitScope` — the enclosing statement's execution context, whether it writes a file through a redirect, and whether its parse was resolved — because a `redirected_statement` owns the redirect its command node does not, and `TSNode` exposes no parent; a nested execution starts with a fresh scope, since an enclosing statement's redirect is not the substitution's. `unresolvedScope` marks every unit at or beneath a node whose subtree the parser could not resolve, so the verdict fold can floor it (#840); it skips `COMMAND_ENUM_DESCEND` members, since `program` / `list` / `pipeline` report an error whenever anything anywhere beneath them failed and asking there would mark every unit of the command. A compound statement (`COMPOUND_STATEMENT_TYPES`) is emitted whole and then descended through `descendStatementChildren`, which recurses only into children named by `STATEMENT_TYPES` and searches the rest for hosted executions; a `STATEMENT_GROUP_TYPES` member (`do_group`, `case_item`, `elif_clause`, `else_clause`) is descended but never emitted. Constraints: `COMMAND_ENUM_SKIP` holds only genuinely inert types (`comment`, `heredoc_end`) — a node that is not a command but can host one belongs in `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES`, and conflating the two questions is the bypass #741 fixed; the `STATEMENT_TYPES` filter is what keeps an operand word (a loop variable, a `case` subject, a function's own name) from being emitted as a command unit; an `ERROR` node is emitted whole and never descended, because tree-sitter's error recovery invents the structure inside one (#742)
│       ├── wrapper-analysis.ts Pure word-based wrapper interpretation: `classifyWrapperWords` (the `WrapperKind` discriminant — `"opaque-payload"` for `bash -c`/`eval`, `"indirection"` for sudo/env/xargs/find -exec/…), `executedUnitOf` (the command a wrapper actually runs), and `isTransparentWrapper` (whether the floor still has a reason to hold), over the shared wrapper vocabulary and one private `unwrapIndirection` walk. Constraints: all three answers read one vocabulary — the shape that floors a unit, the shape that names its inner command, and the shape that exempts it cannot drift; and the two consumers of that walk must part company at an opaque payload, since `executedUnitOf` is display-only and deliberately names what runs *inside* `sh -c`, while a gateable answer read off that string would let a core-looking first word stand for an unparsed program. `isTransparentWrapper` therefore establishes its own inner command and proves it through `proveCommandEffect`, so a retracted core word (`xargs sort -o`) is not exempt
│       ├── bash-path-resolver.ts  `BashPathResolver` class (constructed with a `PathNormalizer` and an optional `workdir`): `resolve(rootNode): ResolvedBashPaths` walks the AST once, tagging each path-candidate token with the `EffectiveBase` in force at its position and the `TokenEffect` its collector proved, and returns `{ externalAccesses: BashExternalPath[], ruleCandidates: BashPathRuleCandidate[] }`; routes every path through the injected `PathNormalizer`. Constraint: both dedup loops keep the effect **out** of the dedup key and merge a repeat through `mergeTokenEffects` — keying on it would split `cat ~/a > ~/a` into two entries and show the path twice in the prompt, while the fold lands two disagreeing proofs on the bare family, which consults both directions anyway. The seeded `workdir` access carries `UNPROVEN_EFFECT`. Both projections fall back to the shared `probeBareToken` for a token the shape gates reject, admitting it only when `normalizer.entryExists` confirms it names a real entry and the effective base is known; `projectRuleCandidates` passes `this.normalizer.flavor` so a win32 backslash-relative token is recognized like its `/` form; `projectExternalPaths` decides outside-cwd from the `AccessPath`'s canonical boundary via `collectIfExternal`, treating a literal-only bash token as unconditionally external. Constraint: consults no ruleset — candidacy is a filesystem question and the decision belongs to the gates (ADR 0009). The subtlest region in the package
│       ├── redirect-analysis.ts Reads a `file_redirect` node well enough to consult the operator table: `redirectEffectForDestination(redirect, destination)` (the effect proved for one destination, `null` for a descriptor duplication) and `redirectMayWriteFile(redirect)`, over one private operator lookup and one private descriptor-node set. Both ask `parseUnresolvedAt` first: a redirect the grammar could not resolve proves nothing (ADR 0013 §10's base case) and refuses the exemption outright. Constraints: the two answers carry different burdens of proof, and must not be collapsed — the token collector asks what to *attribute* to a destination, so it answers with a proof; the command enumerator asks whether it is safe to *remove* the wrapper floor, so it answers with a refusal, and a destination the parse cannot resolve (`> $OUT`, `> $(mktemp)`) counts against the exemption. Reusing the collector's literal-destination filter as a write gate is the fail-open pre-completion review caught in #803. The demotion applies to a proof and never to the `null`, or a descriptor duplication's bare number becomes a path candidate (#814)

Constraints: only an `allow` is floored, so a wrapper unit keeps its own more specific sentinel; and the result spreads the resolved check, so a `source: "session"` grant reaches `GateRunner`'s session fast path, which tests the source before the state (#840). `resolveWrapperUnit` decides a wrapper unit: the `WRAPPER_SENTINEL` floor, or — when the enumerator marked it exempt — the inner command's own `bash` rule, keeping `command` as the wrapper text so the prompt, decision value, and session-approval suggestion name what runs.

│   ├── prompt-payload.ts     `PromptPayload` (the `kind` discriminant, the `request` invariant core, the complete `evidence` list, the `annotations` slot) + `localRequester`/`findEvidence`/`allEvidence` + `asPromptPayload`, the all-or-nothing tolerant guard the forwarded wire's reader narrows through. Constraint: the payload is complete by contract — it never truncates and never decides what a human sees, so elision is a property of a render (ADR 0011 §2). The guard lives beside its type so a new request fact updates it next door rather than in a distant reader
│   ├── tool-ask-payload.ts   `buildToolAskPayload` — the bash, MCP, and generic-tool asks; carries the invoked tool name when a shell alias re-exposes bash (#574) and the wrapper's executed unit (#713)
│   ├── path-ask-payload.ts   `buildPathAskPayload`, `buildExternalDirectoryAskPayload`, `buildBashExternalDirectoryAskPayload` — each escaping path carries its canonical alias as that evidence entry's `detail`, so a bounded render cannot show a path while eliding what it resolves to. All three take the deciding `surface` from their gate (a directional member when a tool's identity, a redirect operator, or the pure-reader core proved a direction); the payload `kind` stays coarse so renderer dispatch is independent of the axis
│   ├── skill-ask-payload.ts  `buildSkillAskPayload`, `buildSkillPathAskPayload` — the skill is the decision-relevant value (it is what the policy names); a skill read carries the path it was reached through as evidence
│   ├── forwarded-ask-payload.ts `buildForwardedAskPayload` — a two-branch projection, not a synthesizer: the child's own payload with only `requester` re-stamped to the request's authoritative provenance, or a degraded `kind: "forwarded"` render built from the display fields a payload-less request does carry. Constraint: the serving node is the only party that knows the ask arrived over the wire, so it re-stamps the requester and passes every other child fact through untouched
│   ├── dialog-renderer.ts    `renderPromptDialog(payload, budget, paint)` — the bounded render for the inline dialog and the `select`/`input` fallback: aligned one-fact-per-line layout, a per-field width cap, a row budget over the evidence, and whole-token highlighting of the flagged element. Also `RenderBudget`/`DEFAULT_RENDER_BUDGET`/`resolveRenderBudget` (the configured budget) and `completeViewBudget` (the complete view). Constraint: the row budget bounds evidence and the field cap bounds the core — a core fact is shortened, never dropped (ADR 0011 §3 over §5)
│   ├── line-fitting.ts       `fitLinesToWidth` — wrap-then-truncate to a terminal width, so each line is one visual row; shared by the `ctx.ui.custom` dialog, whose contract requires it, and by the renderer, which cannot count rows before wrapping
│   ├── fact-vocabulary.ts    `flaggedElements`/`flaggedElementLabel`/`valueLabel`/`describeBashCommandContext` — the render vocabulary shared by every renderer over a payload: which element an ask flags, what it is called, and how a nested execution context reads. Owned by no renderer, so the dialog, the agent text, and the review log cannot disagree about what an ask is flagging

The dispatch reads the unwrapped decider *and* the outer `forwarded` frame, so a refusal decided one hop away says another session decided without naming which. `renderEscalatedPolicyDenial` names the deciding node's rule rather than the payload's `matchedPattern` (the rule that raised this session's own ask), which is why `identification` takes its rule clause as a parameter and `askRuleClause` names the local one. Constraint: it identifies the call and never reproduces it (ADR 0011 §7) — the bash command is never rendered, and the flagged path/target/skill is capped; the link name and the deciding rule's pattern are operator config rather than agent input, so they are not capped. Constraint: ADR 0011 §10 bounds what a forwarded refusal may disclose — a deciding rule's pattern, its deny reason, and an escalation's error text may cross; the responder session id and the rule's `origin` may not
│   └── review-log-renderer.ts `renderReviewLogFacts(payload)` — the request facts the review log persists (ADR 0011 §6), and no evidence or annotations. Constraint: exposure does not grow — evidence is the unbounded part `docs/decisions/0010-permission-log-secret-exposure.md` bounds
├── tool-input-preview.ts              Pure tool-input text utilities (truncation, line counting, count formatting), serialization + default constants; `serializeToolInputPreview` (prompt, unredacted) and `serializeRedactedToolInputPreview` (log) are separate entry points because the input is flattened to a string before the writer sees its keys

Constraint: each variant is self-contained (it repeats its own surface/pattern/origin/name/reason) because the forwarded response file carries no such columns to lean on; the recursive `forwarded` variant is read off disk, so its guard is depth-bounded and rejects an over-deep chain whole rather than truncating it
│   ├── decision-resolution.ts `resolutionFor(decidedBy, outcome)` — the one place a `DecisionSource` becomes a `PermissionDecisionResolution`, shared by the gate runner and the serving node so the two records of one request cannot disagree. Constraint: exhaustive with no `default`, so a new decider variant is a compile error rather than a silent `user_approved`; `outcome` supplies only what the decider does not record (allowed, and whether the human scoped the grant to the session)

│   ├── delegation-envelope.ts `encloseInDelegationEnvelope(authorize)` + `DELEGATION_EXCLUDED_SURFACES` - the bounded-delegation checkpoint (ADR 0007 §5): caps a link's `allow` on an excluded surface **family** (`external_directory`/`path` and their directional members, or an undetermined surface, fail-safe) to `defer`; deny/defer pass through. Constraint: membership is tested on `surfaceFamilyOf(surface)`, not the literal name, so a directional key cannot escape the envelope (ADR 0013 §4) while *which* families are excluded stays independently relaxable
│   ├── local-user-authorizer.ts `LocalUserAuthorizer` class - `TerminalAuthorizer` for a session with UI and the single `permissions:ui_prompt` emit site: renders a forwarded ask's provenance as a non-degraded broadcast + `(Subagent)` title, then dispatches to the inline keybind dialog (TUI) or the `select`/`input` fallback. `buildRequestOptions` is the one place that decides which options an ask offers, composing three independent groups - the session label, the both-directions width, the forwarded scope - from the grants it already reads
│   ├── permission-dialog.ts   Dialog option semantics + `requestPermissionDecisionFromUi` (`select`/`input` fallback) + `PermissionPromptDecision` (whose `decidedBy` is required) and `UnattributedDecision` (the same minus it); the mode dispatch lives in `permission-prompt-component.ts`. `sessionGrantWidth` is orthogonal to `state` rather than a value of it, because the forwarded-response reader rejects an unrecognized `state` outright and merely drops an unrecognized field; absent means the proven direction, so a narrow grant serializes as it did before the width option existed
│   ├── permission-prompt-decision.ts Pure decision model (`reducePrompt` + `PromptModelConfig`/`PromptViewState`) for the inline keybind dialog - hotkey arming (double-press), step transitions, reason validation; no SDK/TUI imports. `visibleOptionKeys(config)` is the single home for which options an ask offers - the `b` width option appears iff the config carries a label for it - so the component renders the roster rather than declaring a second copy of it
│   ├── permission-prompt-component.ts Inline `ctx.ui.custom<UnattributedDecision>` keybind dialog (TUI) driven by the decision model + the `requestPermissionDecision` mode dispatcher (tui → inline, else fallback); the reason step delegates to the pi-tui `Input` line editor (rebuilt per visit, so a backed-out draft cannot be undone back into a later ask) and forwards Pi's `app.tools.expand` action in the decision/scope steps only, never during reason entry. Renders whichever option rows `visibleOptionKeys(config)` names rather than holding a roster of its own, with `labelFor` supplying the two session rows' ask-derived labels. Constraint: the dispatcher is the one place a human surface is chosen, so it is where the decision is attributed (`decidedBy: {kind: "user", via}`) - the dialog model and the fallback each naming themselves would be two sites that must agree with its branch
│   ├── bracketed-paste.ts     `collapsePastedNewlines(data)` - rewrites the content between a chunk's `\x1b[200~`/`\x1b[201~` markers so each newline run becomes one space, keeping a multi-line paste readable in the single-line reason field (the line editor deletes newlines outright, joining the words across a break); markers preserved, anything that is not a complete paste chunk returned unchanged
│   ├── denying-authorizer.ts  `DenyingAuthorizer` class - least-privilege `TerminalAuthorizer` for a session with no reachable authority; denies with the `confirmationUnavailable` marker so the ask path derives the `confirmation_unavailable` resolution, attributed `decidedBy: {kind: "unavailable"}`
│   ├── authorizer-selection.ts `AuthorizerSelection` class - context-owning `AskEscalator` implementation (`escalate(details)`) and the `AdjudicationRole` seam (`adjudicatesLocally()`, read by the service lifecycle and the registration observer so neither re-derives the role from subagent detection); selects the authority once per activation, and per ask resolves the `authorizerChain` config to registered links (config order; unregistered names skipped fail-safe with an `authorizer_chain_unregistered_link` review event; consulted names recorded as `authorizer_chain_resolved`; each wrapped in the delegation envelope), composes them via `composeAuthorizerChain`, and delegates via `PermissionPrompter`; a relaying node resolves none and records `authorizer_chain_delegated` instead (one chain per node, ADR 0007 §7)
│   ├── permission-prompter.ts `PermissionPrompter` class (`PermissionPrompterApi`) - review-log bracketing (waiting → approved/denied) around `authorizer.authorize(details)`, recording the decision's `decidedBy` on the outcome entries only (the waiting entry has no decider yet); `PromptPermissionDetails` type (carries the child-fixed `accessIntent` facts a forwarded ask relays)

│   ├── forwarding-liveness.ts The filesystem half of the same question, for a child that shares no memory with its parent: `ServingHeartbeatStore` (a `ServingAnnouncer` publishing `<forwardingDir>/serving/<id>.json` with the served session, its pid, and its refresh time; throttled, never throws, and sweeps records of dead processes once per session) + `HeartbeatReader` classifying a target as alive/absent/stale/dead_pid + `ForwardingLivenessJudge` (`TargetServingLookup`), which routes a liveness question to the channel that can answer it by the target's `self`/`registry`/`env` provenance. Constraint: the records live beside `sessions/`, never inside it, so liveness stays disjoint from the request/response cleanup ordering (#398)
│   ├── subagent-lifecycle-events.ts subscribeSubagentLifecycle() - subscribes to @gotgenes/pi-subagents child lifecycle events and dispatches each fact to its owner: registers/unregisters child sessions in SubagentSessionRegistry on `session-created`/`disposed`, and hands a `bound` child to `ChildNodeAudit` (ADR 0002). Constraint: the `session-created` handler must stay synchronous, so the registry entry lands before `bindExtensions()` proceeds
│   ├── child-node-audit.ts        `ChildNodeAudit` (`BoundChildAuditor`) - reports an in-process child that bound its extensions without publishing a permission node of its own, so it gates nothing: a `child_node_absent` review entry per affected child, one visible warning per parent session. Constraint: the `bound` channel it reads is optional for a subagent implementation, so a child announced on neither channel is not audited (ADR 0012 decision 5 amendment)
│   ├── inherited-registrations.ts `AncestorNodes` + `InheritingToolAccessExtractorLookup`/`InheritingToolInputFormatterLookup` - completes a node's fact-shaping lookups from its in-process ancestors, nearest first, so an excluded extractor provider cannot leave a child's tool path ungated; the local registry always wins and an inherited answer is tagged `inherited`. Constraint: fact-shaping registries only — no equivalent exists for the authorizer registry, because a link returns a verdict (ADR 0007 §7, ADR 0012 decision 1's fact-shaping clause)

│   ├── approval-escalator.ts  `ParentAuthorizer` class - `TerminalAuthorizer` for a subagent session: escalates the ask up the tree via the request-write/poll machinery, completing the child-fixed facts into a `ForwardedAccessIntent` (stamps `requesterCwd`/`principal`), `ctx` bound at construction; adopts the requester's `requestId` as the forwarded request's `id` (falling back to a fresh mint when it could not safely name a file — at a relay hop that id came off disk); every abandonment path (unresolvable target, unusable directories, unwritable request, unserved target, unreadable response, timeout) denies with `confirmationUnavailable` plus a path-naming `denialReason` — reused verbatim as the `unavailable` decider's reason so the two cannot drift — and discards the request so a late answer cannot arrive; an answered request's decision is nested under a `forwarded` decider carrying the responder's own
│   ├── forwarded-request-server.ts `ForwardedRequestServer` class (`InboxProcessor`) - serving-down role: `processInbox()` drains forwarded requests and resolves each like a local action - `ServingPolicy` (recorded authority) then `AskEscalator` on `ask`; `ServingPolicy.resolve(intent: ForwardedAccessIntent)` is intent-shaped (agent-scoped to `principal.agentName`, child-fixed `matchValues` used as-is, never re-derived through this session's `PathNormalizer`/cwd), floors to `ask` when `accessIntent` is absent (version skew); projects the request's access facts onto the escalated ask (`surface`/`matchValues`/`boundaryValue` only — `requesterCwd`/`principal` stay off the ask details, and the bounded-delegation checkpoint's exclusion reads the projected gate surface, #635); writes its decider onto the response (its own matched rule in full, the escalated decision's source, or a `gate_error` when the escalation itself threw) and carries a denying rule's own deny-with-reason text beside it, so the requesting session can tell its agent why rather than only that; the grant-scope translation rewrites the scope but never the decider; broadcasts the terminal `permissions:decision` for every ask it escalates, rendered from the same `PromptPermissionDetails` its `permissions:ui_prompt` was built from, so a prompt the requesting session's gate would answer on another bus is clearable on this one — a recorded-authority resolution stays silent on both channels; one-hop canary
│   ├── forwarding-io.ts       Forwarding filesystem helpers - request/response read-write (tolerant read of the optional `accessIntent` and `decidedBy` fields; an unusable decider is dropped without rejecting the decision it accompanies), location derivation, atomic JSON writes (owner-only; `rename` preserves the temp file's mode). Constraint: the readers rebuild an allowlist of known fields, so a wire field added without being listed here is silently dropped
│   └── forwarding-manager.ts  `ForwardingController` interface + `ForwardingManager` class - drives the forwarded-permission inbox polling lifecycle; tells `ForwardedRequestServer.processInbox`, and publishes the polled session id to the `ServingAnnouncer` plus a `forwarded_permission.serving_started`/`serving_stopped` review entry. Constraint: the per-tick re-announcement runs ahead of the processing guard, so a session whose human is deliberating at a forwarded dialog keeps announcing while `processInbox` is held open

├── logging.ts                 JSONL review/debug log writer; serializes through `redactedJsonStringify` and creates both logs owner-only. Constraint: `writeLine` is the only place a line is produced, so both the key-name mask and the review stream's width bound live there and no write path can escape either
├── log-field-cap.ts           `capLogFieldWidths` + `resolveReviewLogFieldWidth` + `DEFAULT_REVIEW_LOG_FIELD_MAX_WIDTH` - the review log's `reviewLogFieldMaxWidth` bound. Constraint: narrows by length alone and never reads a value to decide what to shorten, which is what keeps it a cap rather than redaction
├── json-safe-stringify.ts     `createJsonSafeReplacer` (Error → plain object, bigint → string, cycles → `[Circular]`) + `safeJsonStringify`; separate from the writer because the prompt path serializes tool input too, and only the log path redacts

## Improvement roadmap — Phase 14: The capability axis

### Findings (planned 2026-08-24)

The declared candidate is [ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-permission-policy-model.md), accepted 2026-08-22 and amended 2026-08-23, whose Staging section assigns its decomposition to this planning pass — the same relationship [ADR-0011](../decisions/0011-prompt-presentation-contract.md) had to Phase 13.

The cause is a **missing axis in the policy vocabulary**: a surface names *what is touched* and never *what is done to it*.
Design principle 6 now names the repair (capability as a suffix on the surface name), but no surface, rule, or intent carries direction today, so the deterministic layer cannot distinguish a read from a write.
Everything follows from that one gap.
A user who wants to permit reading outside the working tree must permit writing there too, so they permit neither and absorb the prompt; a redirect destination is provably a write and is governed by nothing; a wrapper's inner command is provably a pure reader and is floored to `ask` anyway.
ADR 0013 §1 names it as the single defect behind eight open issues ([#706], [#680], [#620], [#698], [#472], [#604], [#603], [#686]) — eight mechanisms aimed at one missing distinction.
The measured cost is a cause-joint ~51% of current prompts: ~19% tool reads (band A), ~19% provable bash reads (band B), ~13% floored pure-readers.

Phase 14 takes staging slices 1–3, with slice 2 split so that wrapper transparency depends only on the audited core and not on the user-declaration machinery.
Slices 4–7 (redirect projection [#609], blame threading, the sandbox seam [#802], structured bash rules [#804]) are Phase 15's spine.

Corroboration (fallow + sweeps, 2026-08-24): health 78 (B), dead code 0, duplication 0.1% (the two known clone groups, unchanged).
The health score fell from the 88 (A) recorded at Phase 13's archive on a new `hotspots -10.0` deduction; ~40 commits landed on the package in the six days after archiving ([#699], [#786], [#787], [#789], [#794], [#639]), which is a churn-window artifact rather than new structural debt — no other deduction moved and the coupling deduction improved.
The repeated-discriminator sweep found no new family: the survivors are validation-edge `typeof` guards, per-node AST dispatch, and gate-outcome dispatch at a single site, idiomatic per the taxonomy.
The `value-guards.ts` refactoring target remains rejected (healthy high-fan-in leaf, 17 LOC).

The craftsmanship scout **refuted all five** fallow large-function flags on test files — each is a nested tree of small behavior-named tests, with no over-mocking, implementation-coupled assertions, or fused arrange/act/assert.
It found one concentrated production cluster, and it sits inside the files this phase already rewrites: `handlers/gates/bash-path.ts` inlines a token-classification loop its two sibling gates extracted into `external-directory-policy.ts`, `handlers/gates/runner.ts`'s `runDescriptor` carries six numbered phases in one 172-line method, and `rule.ts:143` stacks a stale duplicate doc comment describing a different function.
All three ride Steps 1–2 as tidy-first prep commits rather than earning a step.
The scout explicitly cleared `src/index.ts` (the 292-line composition-root factory and top hotspot at 17.1): its two forward-declared `let`s exist to satisfy a circular closure, so splitting it would fight the requirement for no readability gain.
The one recorded deferred tidying (`test/service.test.ts`'s thrice-repeated root-slot `afterEach`) stays deferred as scattered trivia.

Directory check: every module this phase creates belongs to an existing domain directory (`access-intent/bash/`, `handlers/gates/`, `authority/`), and the root-level files it edits (`normalize.ts`, `config-schema.ts`, `rule.ts`, `permission-manager.ts`) are amended rather than rewritten, so they stay put per the recorded convention — grow a domain directory in the phase that rewrites its files, never as a big-bang move.
Step 1 added one root-level module the check did not anticipate, `restrictiveness.ts`, relocated out of `handlers/gates/` because the core-layer resolver may not import from `handlers/`; it has no domain directory to belong to.

Trajectory: Phase 12's maximum step priority was 20 and Phase 13's was 20; this phase's is 20 (Step 3).
No decline, so the regular improvement rotation continues.

#### Open-issue sweep dispositions

- [#837] — filed by the [#724] retrospective (a `pi-subagents` issue); adopted as Step 13 by operator decision. 62 of 147 `src` files sit at the package root while the directories most of them belong in already exist, and past phases reorganized inconsistently because no target layout was ever written down.
  Folded in here rather than deferred because the phase already carries disruptive work; the move itself is non-breaking, since `service.ts` is the only path-reachable export and nothing imports a deep path.
- [#806] and [#807] — filed for Steps 1 and 2, the two staging slices with no pre-existing issue.
- [#808] — filed by Step 1's planning; adopted as Step 9.
  Step 1 converts `permissionSchema` to a named-property object so the four directional keys carry their own documentation, which leaves the five surfaces people actually write anonymous under `additionalProperties`; closing that asymmetry is a peer-sized piece of the same config-schema surface.
- [#810] — filed by Step 2's planning; adopted as Step 10.
  Step 2 narrows a bash session grant to the direction its gate proved, but `SessionApproval` carries one surface for all its patterns, so a mixed-direction command still records on the bare family.
  Closing that gap touches the forwarded-approval wire, which Step 2 deliberately keeps out of its scope.
- [#813] — filed by Step 2's implementation; adopted as Step 11.
  Step 2's narrowing costs a second prompt in the read-after-write flow, and relieving it is a prompt affordance rather than a reshape of `SessionApproval`, so it stands as its own step beside Step 10 rather than inside it.
- [#803] — adopted as Step 3 (wrapper transparency, ADR 0013 §11 and staging slice 3).
- [#814] — filed by Step 3's implementation; adopted as Step 12.
  Step 3 extracts the `file_redirect` reading into its own module, and writing that module's first direct tests exposed a defect in the operator proof Step 2 shipped — so the correction lands against the surface this phase created rather than waiting for Phase 15's redirect slice ([#609]) to reopen the same file.
- [#742] — adopted as Step 4, having been swept out of Phase 13 as "a strong candidate for the next phase's spine".
  ADR 0013 §10 recasts it as a combinator clause of the verdict fold rather than a patch, so fixing it now is the fold's first clause.
- [#772] — adopted as Step 5; filed by Phase 13 Step 10's implementation and non-gating since.
- [#844] — filed by Step 5's planning; adopted as Step 15 by operator decision.
  Step 5's scope gate fixed the bus event for every decider and the agent-facing text for the `authorizer` arm only, leaving a forwarded denial the parent's rule or a gate error decided still rendered to the child's agent as the user's.
  It stands beside Step 5 rather than inside it because its hard half is an ADR 0011 §6 disclosure question — whether the parent's pattern and origin may reach the requesting agent at all — rather than the mapping Step 5 settles.
- [#796] — adopted as Step 6; its deferral trigger (the last known downstream migrating) fired during [#788]'s ship.
- [#792] and [#793] — adopted as Steps 7 and 8, the two ADR 0012 decision-6 residuals filed with [#789].
- [#799] — deferred with recorded rationale (user composition decision): the channel ADR is deliberative design budget that would compete with the capability axis for the same planning attention, and ADR 0013 §9 has already written its input constraints so nothing decays by waiting.
  It stays the strongest non-code candidate for Phase 15, and PRs [#675], [#692], and [#638] remain blocked on it.
- [#609] — deferred to Phase 15 as staging slice 4; it is a consequence of this phase's axis rather than its motivation (ADR 0013 §1), and it carries the phase's only breaking change, which does not belong in the same release as the axis that must be non-breaking by construction.
- [#840] — filed by Step 4's planning; adopted as Step 14 by operator decision.
- [#861] — filed by Step 8's planning; deferred to a later phase with recorded rationale.
  A locally-adjudicating child skips a configured chain link whose provider did not load there, which shares Steps 7 and 8's cause (a node's machinery is whatever happened to load in it) but not their remedy: Step 8's amendment is scoped so it cannot reach the authority registries, and inheriting a link would run authority the operator's own exclusion removed.
  Deferred rather than adopted because its hard half is a design question — whether the fail-safe skip is the correct resolution of two contradictory operator instructions — and that is the same deliberation budget [#799] was deferred for.
  Nothing decays by waiting: the skip is fail-to-human, so a human still decides every affected ask, where Steps 7 and 8 leave a call gated by nobody.
  Step 4 settled that an `ERROR` node is emitted whole and never descended, which leaves ADR 0013 §10's fail-closed clause the one part of that section still unwritten.
  Step 14 wrote it, and measured that the emitted blob is not the population that matters: 0 of 5269 real commands emit one, while the 2 that fail to parse drop a command from enumeration altogether.
  It stands beside Step 4 rather than inside it because the floor lives in the verdict fold (`bash-command.ts`) rather than the enumerator, and because Step 4 is otherwise a zero-prompt hardening change while this one newly prompts.
- [#839] — filed by Step 4's planning; deferred to Phase 15, then adopted as Step 16 by operator decision.
  Step 4's planning measured the whole nested-command bypass family and found one member that is not a command at all: a path named directly as a `for`/`select` operand or a `case` subject is a child of the statement node, so the path collector — which reads text only from `command` and `file_redirect` nodes — never sees it.
  The original deferral reasoned that Step 4 and its `command_name`-position half change zero path candidates across 4276 real commands, while this one newly asks on `external_directory`, so it did not belong in the same release as an axis that must be non-breaking by construction.
  That reason expired rather than being overruled: the capability-axis batch shipped long ago, so there is no longer a release for it to contaminate, and it ships alone as a `fix!:`.
  The remaining half of the rationale — that it reopens `token-collection.ts`, which Phase 15's redirect slice returns to — argues for landing it *before* that slice rather than after, since the slice would otherwise inherit an unclosed fail-open in the file it rewrites.
- [#875] — filed by Step 14's planning; deferred to a later phase with recorded rationale.
  It is Step 14's own residual, and the part the verdict floor structurally cannot reach: a heredoc redirect combined with `2>&1` and a pipe drops the piped command from enumeration entirely, so a `bash:` deny on it is never consulted and Step 14 can only convert the resulting silence into a prompt.
  Deferred rather than adopted because none of its three candidate fixes is a verdict-fold question — an upstream grammar fix with no lever today (`tree-sitter-bash` is at 0.25.1, npm's latest), a heredoc pre-pass that introduces a second notion of what a bash program is, or an ADR 0013 §10 amendment to hard-deny an unresolved parse.
  Nothing decays by waiting: after Step 14 a human sees the whole command line, including the text the parse dropped, and decides.
- [#868] — filed by Step 9's planning; deferred to a later phase with recorded rationale.
  It shares Step 9's file, defect class (Category F), and clearing mechanism — the `authorizerChain` array element carries no `description`/`markdownDescription`, so the one cursor position where a link name is typed completes and hovers nothing — but not Step 9's parentage.
  Step 9 exists because Step 1 created its asymmetry; this gap has been there since `authorizerChain` was added, no Phase 14 step touches the field, and the capability axis has no bearing on it.
  Nothing decays by waiting, and Phase 15 reopens the same file.
- [#802] and [#804] — deferred to Phase 15 as staging slices 6 and 7.
- [#620] — deferred with recorded rationale (explicit user decision; third consecutive phase).
  Not a silent re-defer: ADR 0013 §7 **narrows its charter** rather than parking it — the classifier now answers the provable slice at zero tokens, so the chain is no longer the only path to read relief and keeps only what genuinely needs judgment.
  Scheduling it this phase would contend for the same bash-surface files as Steps 2 and 3.
  [#698] and [#706] fold into it when it is scheduled.
- [#519] — deferred with recorded rationale (explicit user decision): still externally blocked on Pi SDK `UIContext` evolution, with no in-repo work that unblocks it.
  It closes or schedules when the SDK ships the capability.
- [#751] — deferred with recorded rationale (explicit user decision; second phase).
  It is the last residual of ADR 0011 §4's reachable-complete-view contract and remains small and self-contained, so it stays a cheap independent candidate for any later phase.
- [#797] — the package's only open `bug`, and not planned as a step (explicit user decision).
  `officecli set data.xlsx /Sheet1/B1` passes a spreadsheet cell reference shaped exactly like an absolute path, and ADR 0009 gates an absolute bash token by shape rather than existence — deliberately, because a nonexistent absolute destination is still a write target.
  No deterministic classifier separates the two, so the answer is a config recipe (`external_directory: {"/Sheet1/*": "allow"}`) rather than a mechanism.
  This phase answers the issue with that recipe.
- [#815] — a third-party report that a partially permissive surface (`bash: {"*": "deny", "git *": "ask"}`) hides the tool outright; out of scope for the roadmap and fixed independently.
  No Phase 14 step names `permission-manager.ts`'s tool-level query or `handlers/before-agent-start.ts`, and the capability axis has no bearing on which question tool exposure asks.
- [#821] — a third-party fail-open report (a bracket-glob path token is dropped before any gate sees it); out of scope for the roadmap and fixed independently.
  No Phase 14 step names `access-intent/bash/token-classification.ts`, and the fix is a prelude deletion that ships on its own release.
- [#822] — filed by [#821]'s planning; deferred to a later phase with recorded rationale.
  Gating a glob token by its expansions rather than its literal text is ADR 0009 projection completeness, and it belongs beside the sandbox seam ([#802]) and [#686] in Phase 15 — a sandbox would subsume static expansion, so building the expansion mechanism ahead of that seam risks replacing it immediately.
- [#823] — filed by [#821]'s pre-completion review; out of scope for the roadmap and fixed independently (explicit user decision), and now shipped.
  Its first framing as a false positive was wrong: three flag spellings stop the pattern-first walker from learning the script was supplied — an `=`-embedded long flag, a glued short flag, and the everyday `-A 3` numeric argument, which tree-sitter types `number` — so the walker eats the command's first real operand and `grep -A 3 pattern /etc/passwd` reaches no path surface, a fail-open predating [#821] and untouched by it.
  Recorded here rather than adopted as a step because it is an ordinary bug against `token-collection.ts`, not part of the capability axis; the initial deferral was revised once the bypass half was measured.
- [#735] scenario 2 and [#722] — unchanged from Phase 13: a parent whose turn is occupied stays with the [#722] diagnosis.
- [#762] — out of scope: the `pkg:pi-permission-system` label is contextual and the body targets `pi-autoformat`'s own config-path resolution.
- [#780] — deferred: two ADRs recording the conservative-defaults and outbound-bridge boundaries; documentation work with no dependency on this phase, and the phase's ADR budget is already spent on ADR 0013's implementation.
- Feature issues [#736], [#720], [#691], [#688], [#687], [#686], [#680], [#658], [#654], [#648], [#604], [#603], [#472] — out of scope for a structural phase.
  Eight of them are named by ADR 0013 §1 as aimed at this phase's cause, so the axis narrows what each of them still has to ask for; none is closed by it outright.
- [#874] — filed by [#733]'s planning (a `pi-subagents` issue); out of scope for the roadmap (explicit user decision).
  `config-modal.ts` is one of the repo's only two `ui.custom(..., { overlay: true })` call sites, and Pi's regular-mode compositor writes overlay chrome into the buffer that backs scrollback.
  No Phase 14 step names `config-modal.ts`, and the capability axis has no bearing on how a settings modal is mounted.
  Its exposure is far lower than [#733]'s — smearing needs the buffer to grow while the overlay is open — and its fix is a different design question, because the modal asks for a fixed 82-column width that the non-overlay path does not offer.

Recompute commands (run from the repo root):

- Directional family vocabulary: `grep -cE 'DIRECTIONAL_FAMILIES|CAPABILITY_SUFFIXES|surfaceFamilyOf|surfaceFamilyMembers|capabilitySurfaceForTool' packages/pi-permission-system/src/access-intent/path-surfaces.ts`
  (Step 1 derives the four names from a family set and a suffix list rather than spelling them out, so each appears exactly once in the codebase and a literal-name count reads zero by design.)
- Directional schema keys: `grep -cE 'path_read|path_write' packages/pi-permission-system/src/config-schema.ts`
- Sugar expansion: `grep -c 'expandDirectionalSugar' packages/pi-permission-system/src/normalize.ts`
- Family exclusion: `grep -c 'surfaceFamily' packages/pi-permission-system/src/authority/delegation-envelope.ts`
- Effect module: `ls packages/pi-permission-system/src/access-intent/bash | grep -c 'command-effects'`
- Wrapper predicate: `grep -c 'isTransparentWrapper' packages/pi-permission-system/src/access-intent/bash/wrapper-analysis.ts`
- Enumerator descent: `grep -c 'collectHostedCommands' packages/pi-permission-system/src/access-intent/bash/command-enumeration.ts`
- Authorizer resolutions: `grep -cE 'authorizer_allowed|authorizer_denied' packages/pi-permission-system/src/permission-events.ts`
- ADR 0012 amendments: `grep -c '#### Amendment' packages/pi-permission-system/docs/decisions/0012-cross-node-extension-contract.md`

- Named surface properties: `grep -c 'surfaceProperty' packages/pi-permission-system/src/config-schema.ts`
- Split-provider tests: `grep -rl 'split-provider' packages/pi-permission-system/test | wc -l`
- Statement-operand collection: `grep -cE 'for_statement|case_statement' packages/pi-permission-system/src/access-intent/bash/token-collection.ts`
  (Added with Step 16, which the phase did not carry when it opened; the baseline was verified 0 at the step's planning time.)
- Per-pattern approval surfaces: `grep -c 'ApprovalGrant' packages/pi-permission-system/src/session-approval.ts`
  (Step 10 named the pair type `ApprovalGrant` rather than the roadmap's predicted `ApprovalPattern`, which names a `{surface, pattern}` object after one of its two fields; the row moves with the name, per the clause below.)
- Health/duplication/dead exports: `pnpm fallow health --score --workspace @gotgenes/pi-permission-system` / `pnpm fallow dupes --workspace @gotgenes/pi-permission-system` / `pnpm fallow dead-code --workspace @gotgenes/pi-permission-system`

Eight rows greped for a name the phase had not created when it opened — `expandDirectionalSugar`, `surfaceFamily`, `command-effects.ts`, `isTransparentWrapper`, `authorizer_allowed`/`authorizer_denied`, `child_node_absent`, the `split-provider` test phrase, and `surfaceProperty`.
The step that creates each (Steps 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 respectively) must either use the roadmap's name or update the metric row in the same commit, or the rename silently breaks the delivered-vs-predicted verification at phase close.
Step 1 exercised that clause: it created `expandDirectionalSugar` and `surfaceFamily` under their predicted names, and rewrote the directional-surface row, whose literal-name grep the delivered derivation reads as zero.
Step 10 exercised it again, renaming `ApprovalPattern` to `ApprovalGrant`.
The fallow health score is carried as a floor rather than a target: it is blind to the type-level wins a cause-driven phase produces, and its current value is depressed by a churn artifact this phase does not set out to fix.

### Steps

#### ✅ Step 1: The direction axis — `path_read`, `path_write`, and their boundary twins ([#806])

**Cause:** the policy vocabulary names the object of an access and never its capability, so no rule can say *this is only a read, so it is fine* — the missing axis itself, expressed as config.

- **Smell:** Category C (a distinction the domain requires has no representation).
- **Target:** `src/config-schema.ts` (the four directional keys, with `pnpm run gen:schema`), `src/normalize.ts` (`expandDirectionalSugar` — bare `path` / `external_directory` expand into both directions at load, sugar entries inserted first and explicit directional entries appended after, regardless of textual key order, per ADR 0013 §4), `src/access-intent/path-surfaces.ts` (`PATH_SURFACES` gains the four names so win32 folding and the manager's path handling follow), `src/authority/delegation-envelope.ts` (`DELEGATION_EXCLUDED_SURFACES` becomes a surface-**family** test, not literal membership), the path gates in `src/handlers/gates/` (a tool-surface access has a known direction — `READ_ONLY_PATH_BEARING_TOOLS` proves the read, `write`/`edit` prove the write — while a bash token stays unknown and consults **both** directional surfaces, most-restrictive, per §10's base case), plus `config/config.example.json`, `docs/configuration.md`, and `README.md`.
  Tidy-first prep commits: relocate the restrictiveness ordering out of `handlers/gates/` so the core-layer resolver can fold with it, and restore the orphaned doc comment above `evaluateFirst` in `rule.ts`.
  The roadmap's earlier prep suggestion — extracting `selectUncoveredPathCandidates` in `handlers/gates/bash-path.ts` — was dropped: under the delivered design that file has no diff, so Tidy First's own rule excludes it.
  It is left for Step 2, which rewrites the file for per-token effects.
- **Ordering constraint:** the family-membership conversion must land in the **same commit** as the new surface names.
  A directional key reaching an authorizer link ahead of it is a silent widening of the bounded-delegation envelope (ADR 0013 §4).
- **Outcome:** direction is expressible; every existing config expands to its current meaning exactly, so nothing prompts differently on upgrade; band A (~19% of current asks) becomes relievable by one directional grant.
  The four metrics above move off zero.
- **Landed:** the family fold sits in `PermissionResolver.resolve`, not in the gates.
  Tracing the readers of a bare-surface query found three the Target line above had not: the cross-extension policy query, the `PermissionQuery` injected into every authorizer link, and — the load-bearing one — the recorded-authority view a serving node resolves a **forwarded child request** against.
  A gate-side fold leaves that last reader resolving an emptied surface, so a parent's recorded `path` deny would stop hard-denying a child's request and escalate it to an approvable prompt ([#712]'s defect class).
  Both bash path gates therefore needed no *routing* diff — they still resolve on the bare family surface, and `bash-external-directory.ts` is untouched; `bash-path.ts` changed only to name that surface on the ask payload, which became a required fact.
  The tool-identity attribution table and the two consequences of the independent-bits reading are recorded in ADR 0013's 2026-08-25 amendment.
- **Commit type:** `feat:`.
- **Impact 5 / Risk 3 / Priority 15.**

Release: batch "capability-axis"

#### ✅ Step 2: Effect attribution — syntax proofs and the built-in pure-reader core ([#807])

**Cause:** the same missing axis, one layer down: even with directional surfaces, a bash path token has no effect to attribute, so every token falls to the fail-closed both-surfaces base case and the axis relieves nothing on the bash surface.

- **Smell:** Category C (a fact the parse tree already establishes is discarded before the gate).
- **Target:** new `src/access-intent/bash/command-effects.ts` (the `Effect` vocabulary — `read`, `write`, with `delete` reserved — and the frozen, package-audited pure-reader core, matched as bare basenames only, with `find`'s retraction guard on `-exec`/`-execdir`/`-ok`/`-okdir`/`-delete`); `src/access-intent/bash/token-collection.ts` and `bash-path-resolver.ts` attribute an effect per **token**, not per command, so `cat ~/a | tee ~/b` reads `~/a` and writes `~/b` in one unit; `src/handlers/gates/bash-path.ts` and `bash-external-directory.ts` route a proven-effect token to that effect's surfaces and an unproven one to both.
  Syntax proofs are absolute and unretractable: an output redirect destination is a write, an input redirect is a read, and `2>&1` is not a file access.
  Tidy-first prep commit: split `runDescriptor`'s six numbered phases in `handlers/gates/runner.ts` into private methods before this step extends that dispatch.
- **Constraint:** the core is frozen, always active, and not user-removable; a user who distrusts `cat` is served by the ask-everything fallback, not by removal machinery.
  Admission is argument-independence across GNU and BSD alike, which is what keeps this from being the package-maintained fail-open command table ADR 0009 rejected.
- **Outcome:** band B (~19% of current asks) becomes relievable by a directional read grant; the review log records which source classified a unit (syntax or core), so a surprising allow is auditable to the line that produced it.
- **Commit type:** `refactor:` (hidden — ships in the same release as Steps 1 and 3).
- **Impact 5 / Risk 3 / Priority 15.**

Landed: the vocabulary split across `access-intent/effect.ts` (core-layer, so `path-surfaces.ts` can consume it) and `access-intent/bash/command-effects.ts` (the bash-specific proofs), rather than the single module the step sketched.
`EffectSource` gained a fourth value, `retracted`, so "nobody claimed anything about `pnpm`" and "`find` is core and `-delete` withdrew the claim" read as different diagnoses.
The roster shipped at 21 words with guards on `find`, `fd`, and `sort` — the plan's 22nd, `file`, was dropped in pre-completion review because `-C`/`--compile` writes a `magic.mgc` file, so it failed the roster's own bar.
Measured against the local review log by `scripts/measure-core-coverage.mjs` (2026-08-27: 804 bash asks, 230 recent), every unit head word is in the core for **23.0% of recent asks and 35.9% of all-time**.
The plan's 27.9%/36.9% came from a scan that had not applied the retraction guards; with them applied the recent figure is ~6 points lower, and all 14 asks the guards exclude are `find … -exec <core reader> {} +` — already floored to `ask` by the indirection wrapper, and therefore Step 3's population rather than relief this step forfeits.
Dropping `file` moved neither figure: it appears in one ask out of 804.
The `runDescriptor` tidy-first prep was dropped: provenance rides in each gate's `logContext`, which the runner already spreads, so `runner.ts` has zero diff and Tidy First's own rule excludes it.
Narrowing the session grant to the proven direction costs a second prompt in the read-after-write flow; that is [#813], adopted as Step 11.

Release: batch "capability-axis"

#### ✅ Step 3: Wrapper transparency — argument-independence defeats the floor's reason ([#803])

**Cause:** the indirection floor guards unknowability of *scope*, but it is applied as if it guarded unknowability of *direction* — so `xargs grep -l foo` is forced to `ask` even though no arguments exist that make `grep` write a file.
The floor's reason does not hold for the one class the core is defined by.

- **Smell:** Category C (a guard whose trigger is wider than its justification), with the largest measured symptom in the record: floored prompts are 27–28% of all prompts in the two most recent months, 40–55% of them with a pure-reader inner command.
- **Target:** `src/access-intent/bash/wrapper-analysis.ts` (`isTransparentWrapper` — the executed inner unit's head is a bare-basename core word and the unit carries no real output redirect), consumed by `src/handlers/gates/bash-command.ts` so a transparent wrapper resolves by the inner command's own rules instead of the `WRAPPER_SENTINEL` synthetic `ask`.
- **Constraint:** everything else keeps the floor untouched — interpreters, `bash -c`/`eval` opaque payloads, mutators, and any wrapper whose inner command is unresolvable (`executedUnitOf` fails to `null`, and that discipline is retained). v1 exempts on the **built-in core only**: a user `commandEffects` declaration participates in classification but does not lift the floor, because a user's argument-independence claim fails open behind a wrapper.
  An explicit `deny`/`ask` on the wrapper unit is never weakened.
- **Outcome:** `xargs grep -l foo` under a matching `bash` allow stops prompting while `xargs rm`, `xargs sed`, `time pnpm test`, and `find -exec sh -c '…' \;` still do; ~13% of current prompt volume relieved, the single largest deterministic relief in ADR 0013.
- **Commit type:** `fix:` — the release vehicle for batch "capability-axis".
- **Impact 5 / Risk 2 / Priority 20.**

Landed: measured by `scripts/measure-wrapper-transparency.mjs` (2026-08-27), wrapper-floored asks are 91 of 328 prompts across 2026-07 and 2026-08 (27.7%) and 43 of them are relieved — 13.1% of all prompts, 47.3% of floored ones.
That script also prices each conservative clause, so no figure here rests on prose: dropping the opaque-payload refusal would relieve 6 more asks, and the redirect clause and the rejected `sudo`/`doas` carve-out cost 0 each.
The predicate could not be built on `executedUnitOf`, which the step's Target line named: it unwraps *through* an opaque payload by design, so `xargs -I{} sh -c 'grep -l x {}'` names `grep -l x {}` and a predicate reading that string would exempt an unparsed shell program.
The two functions share one `unwrapIndirection` walk and part company at the opaque layer instead.
Core *membership* was likewise the wrong test — `xargs sort -o /tmp/x` has a core head word and writes — so the predicate proves the inner command through `proveCommandEffect` and inherits Step 2's retraction guards behind the wrapper.
The verdict is the inner command's own rule rather than a lifted floor, so a `deny` on the inner command now reaches the wrapper, which the floor had softened to a prompt.
`sudo`/`doas` are ordinary wrappers by explicit decision: the path surfaces gate `sudo cat X` exactly as `cat X`, modelling OS refusal would be a principal axis this package has nowhere else, and `bash: {"sudo *": "ask"}` settles it in one line (shipped as a `docs/configuration.md` recipe; measured cost of the rejected carve-out: 0 asks).
The redirect fact needed a new `redirect-analysis.ts` owner, since tree-sitter-bash hangs `file_redirect` off the parent statement and `TSNode` exposes no parent; giving it one surfaced [#814], adopted as Step 12.
That owner answers the exemption with a **refusal** rather than a write proof, which pre-completion review established the hard way: the first implementation reused the token collector's `ARG_NODE_TYPES` filter, so `xargs grep foo > $OUT`, `>${OUT}`, and `> $(mktemp)` were exempted — a real write to a run-time-chosen path, and the one shape the path projection does not collect either ([#609]), so the floor had been its only guard.
The audit fact rides the gate's `logContext` rather than `PromptRequestFacts`, leaving that published contract untouched.

Release: batch "capability-axis"

#### ✅ Step 4: Enumerate commands in every catch-all node type ([#742])

**Cause:** the command enumerator answers "is this node a command?"
and "can this node host one?"
correctly for redirects and heredocs since [#741], but its catch-all branch still emits any other named statement whole without descending — so a command inside an `if` body, a `declaration_command`, a `test_command`, or an `unset_command` is matched against the bash rules only as part of the enclosing string, and an `rm *` deny never fires.
This is the last member of the [#306] / [#741] nested-command bypass family, and ADR 0013 §10 recasts it as a combinator clause ("any unhandled node type: fail closed") rather than a patch.

- **Smell:** Category C (a boundary flaw with a user-visible bypass).
- **Target:** `src/access-intent/bash/command-enumeration.ts`'s catch-all branch descends for nested executions through the existing `forEachNestedExecution` / `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES` seam in `nested-execution.ts` rather than adding a third traversal; control-flow conditions and bodies, function definitions, `declaration_command`, `test_command`, `unset_command`, and `variable_assignment` all reach the command surface.
  The path surface already handles most of these, so this closes an asymmetry rather than opening a surface.
- **Design question the step must settle:** a control-flow body runs in the current shell, so it has no distinct execution context to tag — whether it emits with no `context` (like a top-level chain member) or earns a `BashCommandContext` variant is a prompt-quality decision, since `context` is what explains *why* a nested command was gated.
- **Outcome:** `if true; then rm y; fi` resolves `deny` under an `rm *` rule; the enclosing statement is still emitted whole, so the change can only ever be more restrictive, never weaker; `grep -c 'collectHostedCommands'` in the enumerator goes 3 → ≥ 4.
- **Commit type:** `fix:`.
- **Impact 4 / Risk 2 / Priority 16.**

Landed: the enumerator gained the third question the step's Target sketched as a catch-all descent, because a blanket descent was measurably wrong.
A compound statement's named children are a mix of statements and operand words, so descending all of them emitted `for` word-list entries, `case` subjects, and function names as bash command units — never weaker, but a prompt naming a package as the offending *command* is wrong on its face.
The answer is `STATEMENT_TYPES` plus a filtered `descendStatementChildren`, beside `COMPOUND_STATEMENT_TYPES` (emitted whole, then descended) and `STATEMENT_GROUP_TYPES` (`do_group` / `case_item` / `elif_clause` / `else_clause` — descended, never emitted).
A non-statement child is still searched for the executions it hosts, which is what reaches `for f in $(rm x)`.
`grep -c 'collectHostedCommands'` in the enumerator is 5.

The step's design question settled as no new `BashCommandContext` variant: a control-flow body runs in the current shell, so it has no distinct execution context to name, and the enum is validated by `BASH_COMMAND_CONTEXTS` in a tolerant reader an older serving node uses on a forwarded request (ADR 0012), which an unknown value would make reject the whole payload.
An `ERROR` node's recovered structure is deliberately not descended — tree-sitter *invents* it, so an unterminated heredoc's backtick-quoted prose parses as commands — which made the unparsed blob a first-class unit and left ADR 0013 §10's fail-closed clause to [#840], where the floor is keyed on the parse's health rather than on that blob.
The scope relays unchanged into a compound statement, so [#803]'s floor exemption is still withheld from every wrapper under a write-establishing redirect.

The path surface's matching hole closed in the same change: both token walkers skipped a `command_name` and a `variable_assignment` child without searching them, so a substitution in either prefix position projected no candidate at all while the same substitution in argument position always did.
Measured by `scripts/measure-statement-descent.mjs` (2026-08-29) over 4348 intact local review-log commands, 191 (4.4%) gain command units (+842).
Eleven of those added units carry a wrapper head and floor `allow` to `ask` through the pre-existing wrapper floor; none newly denies, and no user needs to edit config.
The same run reports **zero** commands carrying a prefix-position substitution, which bounds the path half's blast radius from above — `pathRuleCandidates()` and `externalAccesses()` change on no command in the log, re-derivable without checking out the pre-change source.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 5: An authorizer link's verdict is attributed to the link, not the human ([#772])

**Cause:** `deriveResolution` maps an `ask` gate resolved to `allow` onto `user_approved` unless a session approval or the yolo flag explains it, and the chain runs inside `AskEscalator.escalate` where the runner never learns which link answered — so the one fact [#726] added everywhere else (who decided) is discarded at exactly the collection point that already captures `autoApproved` and `confirmationUnavailable`.
The review log is correct; the bus event is the single record that mis-attributes.

- **Smell:** Category C (a fact established at the decision point dies before one of its two consumers), the same shape as Phase 13 Steps 6 and 9.
- **Target:** `src/permission-events.ts` gains `authorizer_allowed` / `authorizer_denied` on `PermissionDecisionResolution`; `src/handlers/gates/runner.ts` reads `decision.decidedBy.kind` at the same point in `runDescriptor` that already reads the other two flags; `src/handlers/gates/helpers.ts`'s `deriveResolution` branches on it.
- **Note:** this changes the `resolution` an existing local decision reports rather than only adding a value, so whether it warrants a major bump is part of the step's decision — it is not additive the way [#752] was.
- **Outcome:** a consumer can distinguish "the operator approved this" from "a policy extension approved this" on the bus, matching what the review log has recorded since [#726]; `grep -cE 'authorizer_allowed|authorizer_denied'` goes 0 → 2.
- **Commit type:** `feat!:` — the operator settled the bump note as breaking.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 1 / Priority 15.**

Landed: the branch the Target line sketched became a total mapping, because counting the log found the larger half of the defect.
Across 12,281 review-log lines every terminal entry written since [#726], 13 carry an `authorizer` decider — and 68 carry a `forwarded` one, of which 57 were decided by a **rule in the parent session** and broadcast as the operator's approval.
So `deriveResolution` and `forwarded-request-server.ts`'s `servedResolution` both dissolved into one `resolutionFor(decidedBy, outcome)` (`authority/decision-resolution.ts`) over an exhaustive switch, fed by `effectiveDecider` (`authority/decision-source.ts`), which unwraps a `forwarded` hop to the decider inside the responding session.
The two parallel derivations are gone; a decider variant added later is a compile error at the one site.

The step's own bump note settled as breaking (`feat!:`), and the agent-facing half shipped with it: `renderRefusal` dispatches the denial text on the same decider, so the reported case now reads "The 'model-judge' authorizer denied this ..." rather than attributing it to a human who never saw the prompt.
Its `rule` and `gate_error` arms were deliberately left on the user render and adopted as Step 15 ([#844]) — the serving session's pattern and origin are not on the child's payload, so naming a rule there would name the child's own ask rule, and whether those facts may cross the hop is an ADR 0011 §6 disclosure question.

Two findings the plan did not predict.
`PermissionGateResult` gained a `decidedBy` on both arms: the plan had `runDescriptor` capture the escalated decision in a closure variable, which TypeScript narrows to its initializer because the assignment inside the callback is invisible to control-flow analysis.
The gate is the one place that knows whether recorded authority or an escalation answered, so it reports that rather than leaving the caller to reconstruct it — and the runner keeps no capture at all.
And `PermissionPromptDecision.autoApproved` turned out to have no producer in `src/` at all (yolo short-circuits ahead of escalation since [#712]), so it was removed rather than carried; the `yolo` decider is how an auto-approval names itself now.

`grep -cE 'authorizer_allowed|authorizer_denied' src/permission-events.ts` is 2.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 6: Schedule the process-root service slot's removal ([#796])

**Cause:** ADR 0012 decision 7 deferred the root slot's removal on a condition — downstream migration — that has since been met, and nothing tracks it.
The deferral's trigger fired during [#788]'s ship and its only record was an Open Question in a shipped plan plus a table row, neither of which the backlog sweeps: a decision with a fired trigger and no owner.

- **Smell:** Category A (a mechanism populated every session and read by nothing), scoped as a decision rather than a removal.
- **Target:** an ADR 0012 amendment deciding three things — whether `getRootPermissionsService()` is removed in the next major or the `DEP0001` deprecation window stays open for consumers we cannot see; whether the slot should stop being **written** (`publishRootPermissionsService` in `src/service-lifecycle.ts`, a separate question from retiring its public reader); and what becomes of the [#302] child guard whose only remaining purpose is protecting that slot from an in-process child.
- **Outcome:** the decision is recorded where the sweep will find it rather than in a shipped plan's Open Questions; `grep -c '#### Amendment'` on ADR 0012 goes 2 → ≥ 3.
  Whether code changes in this step is the step's own decision; nothing is blocked either way.
- **Commit type:** `docs:` (hidden) — the deliverable is an ADR amendment; any code it schedules lands in a later step or a later phase.
- **Impact 2 / Risk 2 / Priority 8.**

Landed: all three questions resolved the same way — remove, stop writing, dissolve — so the step shipped code as well as the amendment.
They are not three decisions: removing the reader leaves nothing that reads the slot, and removing the write leaves the [#302] guard with nothing to guard.

The argument that closed the deprecation window is a fact about its population rather than its length.
`getRootPermissionsService` did not exist before `v27.0.0` — it is the name that release gave the old behavior when [#794] reclaimed `getPermissionsService` for the keyed locator — and that same release already broke the zero-arg spelling it replaced.
So no consumer predating the deprecation can be calling it; every possible caller adopted a symbol marked `@deprecated` at first sight, after being warned, in preference to the keyed locator the migration guide recommends.
A warning tombstone (an export answering `undefined` forever) was declined on the same reading: it would be a silent behavior change for exactly that population, and would need its own removal later.

The removal took `RegisteredChildDetector`, `SubagentDetection.isRegisteredChild`, and `PermissionServiceLifecycle`'s detection dependency with it; the pure `isRegisteredSubagentChild` stays, because `isSubagentExecutionContext` still calls it.
`PI_PERMISSION_SYSTEM_WARN0001` survives with its message rewritten — it guards a caller the type checker cannot reach, which is a live case, where `DEP0001` guarded a path that no longer exists.
`grep -c '#### Amendment'` on ADR 0012 is 3.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 7: Alarm when a registered in-process child session has no permission node ([#792])

**Cause:** gating is node-local (ADR 0012 decision 1), so a child that loads no instance of this extension has no `tool_call` gate, no tool filtering, no `permission:` frontmatter resolution, and no ask-forwarding — and the parent's own gating is unaffected, so the operator watches the permission system work and never learns the child is unguarded.
One line of `excludedExtensionPackages` in `subagents.json` reaches that state, and so does a load failure inside the child.

- **Smell:** Category C (a policy hole that is observable to the parent node and reported by nobody).
- **Target:** the parent node already holds both signals — every in-process child session id is registered from `subagents:child:session-created`, and since [#699] every node publishes a keyed service — so a registered child that has published no keyed service by its first turn is a child with no permission node.
  The alarm writes a `child_node_absent` review-log event and a visible warning; `src/authority/subagent-registry.ts` and `src/service-lifecycle.ts` hold the two halves.
- **Design questions the step must settle:** where the check fires, since there is no parent-side "the child's first turn" event and the timing needs a real seam rather than a sleep; whether the parent can (or needs to) distinguish deliberate exclusion from a load failure; and whether to warn or refuse — refusing means one package overriding another's settings, which cuts against ADR 0002's separation.
- **Outcome:** an ungated child is announced rather than silent; `grep -rn 'child_node_absent' src` goes 0 → ≥ 1.
- **Commit type:** `feat:`.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 2 / Priority 12.**

Landed: the design question the step named — where the check fires — was answered by eliminating candidates against the code rather than by choosing among them.
Auditing at `disposed` is unusable because `SubagentSession.dispose()` awaits the child's `session_shutdown`, which unpublishes the keyed service, *before* emitting `disposed`; a healthy child would false-alarm.
A sweep of registered children on the parent's next `before_agent_start` is post-hoc by construction — a foreground child runs to completion inside the parent's own tool call — and is not reliably reachable either, since a completed child stays registered only until pi-subagents' interval retention sweep releases its session.
So the step's target was wrong in one respect: `subagent-registry.ts` holds no half of the alarm, because the registry cannot answer *when*.

The seam is a new **optional** `subagents:child:bound` channel in pi-subagents, emitted after `bindExtensions()` resolves — which awaits every child `session_start`, making it the first instant at which "this child published a service" is settled.
Optional rather than required so ADR 0012 decision 5's obligation stays at two events and no existing implementation becomes non-conformant; the amendment records it.
The other two questions resolved as the issue leaned: warn rather than refuse ([ADR-0002] separation), and no attempt to distinguish exclusion from a load failure, since both leave the identical absence — the message names the likelier cause and admits the other.

The two halves fire at different rates: a `child_node_absent` review entry per affected child, one visible warning per parent session.
The warn-once latch needs no re-arm hook, because the extension factory is re-invoked per session generation.
`grep -rn 'child_node_absent' src` is 1.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 8: Close or announce the split-provider access-extractor gap ([#793])

**Cause:** ADR 0012 decision 6 names a hazard and states the contract cannot prevent it, but checked against pi-subagents' actual exclusion semantics the hazard is **narrower and sharper** than the ADR reads.
Excluding a package normally removes its tools and their extractors together, so nothing is weakened; a gap needs a **split** between providers — package A registers tool `deploy` whose path lives under `input.target`, package B registers the extractor for it, and the operator excludes B from children.
The child then gates `deploy` with no extractor, its path never reaches the child's `path` / `external_directory` gates, and the parent gates its own calls correctly, so the weakening is visible nowhere.

- **Smell:** Category C (a security surface degrading silently across a node boundary), and Category F in its cross-package half.
- **Target:** decide between the issue's two mechanisms and implement it.
  **A — child-side diagnostic:** warn once per tool name and record it when a child gates a tool whose extractor is registered in the parent node but not locally; reports the gap without closing it, needs a lookup surface `PermissionsService` does not expose today (there is a registrar, no reader), and introduces a cross-node read ADR 0012 currently limits to the forwarded ask and the serving heartbeat.
  **B — parent read-through fallback:** an in-process child's extractor lookup falls back to the parent node's registry, which makes decision 6's "riding along is harmless by construction" hold unconditionally — at the cost of an ADR 0012 decision 1 amendment distinguishing *where a registration lands* (unchanged: node-local) from *lookup fallback inside one process* (new).
  Whether that distinction is principled or a crack in the law is the thing to deliberate.
  Preview formatters split the same way but are cosmetic; only extractors are a security surface.
  Out-of-process children are out of scope for B — no shared `globalThis`, and the exclusion is in-process only.
- **Outcome:** the split-provider condition is either impossible or announced, replacing the interim by-hand check [#789] shipped in pi-subagents' `docs/configuration.md`; `grep -rl 'split-provider' test` goes 0 → ≥ 1.
- **Commit type:** `feat:` — mechanism B landed.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 2 / Priority 12.**

Landed: mechanism B, and the deliberation the step was adopted to settle resolved by finding the distinction already in ADR 0012 rather than inventing one.
A candidate framing — "capability is inherited, policy is node-local", spanning all three registries — was drafted and withdrawn: it lumped extractors, formatters, and chain links under one word, and the first two produce a **fact** while the third produces a **verdict**, which is decision 1's own axis.
The amendment therefore adds one clause to that axis (a fact-shaping registration's *lookup* may cross an in-process node boundary; where it *lands* is unchanged) instead of naming a new concept.

That correction changed the answer, not just the wording.
The all-three-registries option was not merely broader but wrong: `selectAuthorizer` tests `hasUI` first, so a subagent with its own UI adjudicates locally, and inheriting links would have run authority an operator's own `excludedExtensionPackages` removed.
The two cases also differ in declared intent — an extractor appears in no config, while a link's name is written in `authorizerChain` — so the live-authority case is a conflict to resolve rather than a capability to restore, and it is filed as [#861] and deferred.
A composition-root guard test fails if the authorizer registry is ever added to the inheriting wiring.

Two costs are recorded rather than hidden: a child is no longer explainable from the child alone (mitigated by the `extractorSource: "inherited"` stamp on every affected decision), and the repair is in-process only, since an out-of-process child shares no `globalThis` and an extractor is a closure.
The deeper root — fact-shaping intent is declared nowhere, so a node cannot statically know it is missing an extractor — is named in the amendment and deliberately left standing.

`grep -rl 'split-provider' packages/pi-permission-system/test | wc -l` is 1.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 9: Name the well-known permission surfaces in the config schema ([#808])

**Cause:** Step 1 converts `permissionSchema` from a bare record to a named-property object so the four directional keys carry editor autocomplete and hover documentation.
The five surfaces people actually write — `path`, `external_directory`, `bash`, `mcp`, `skill` — stay anonymous `additionalProperties`, and their documentation stays fused into one ~2000-character `markdownDescription` on the `permission` object that an editor cannot bind to the key under the cursor.

- **Smell:** Category F (documentation that exists but is not reachable from where it is needed).
- **Target:** `src/config-schema.ts` gains a `surfaceProperty` helper building one named property per well-known surface, applied to the five above beside Step 1's four directional keys, with `.catchall(...)` retained so tool-name surfaces keep validating; each surface's prose moves out of the object-level `markdownDescription` onto its own property, leaving the object-level text to cover the flat shape, the string-vs-map shorthand, last-match-wins, and the global → project → agent merge order.
  Regenerated with `pnpm run gen:schema`; the parity test in `test/config-schema.test.ts` guards the drift.
- **Outcome:** every well-known surface completes and self-documents in a schema-aware editor; `grep -c 'surfaceProperty'` on `config-schema.ts` goes 0 → ≥ 9.
- **Commit type:** `feat:` — the generated schema ships in the tarball, so new completions and hover text are user-observable.
- **Impact 2 / Risk 1 / Priority 10.**
- **Landed:** ten named properties, not five — the operator added `"*"`, the universal fallback and the most-written key of all, and declined the six built-in file tools, whose paragraph therefore stays object-level.
  `grep -c 'surfaceProperty'` reads 11; the object-level `markdownDescription` went 2034 → 969 characters and the generated schema 20,475 → 24,601 bytes.
  A test caps any one property at 800 characters and the object's own at 1200, so the blob cannot re-form one property at a time.
  Two findings came out of running the plan's killing mutations: dropping `.catchall(...)` does not fail closed but makes zod **strip** every tool-name surface while `safeParse` still succeeds (the pin asserting only `.success` was vacuous and now asserts the parsed data), and the more precise inferred `FlatPermissionConfig` made `expandDirectionalSugar`'s explicit-`undefined` guard unreachable by type though it is live at runtime.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 10: A session approval records the direction the gate proved ([#810])

**Cause:** Step 2 proves a direction per bash path token and narrows the session grant to it — but only where one direction covers the whole gate.
`SessionApproval` holds one surface for many patterns, so the external-directory gate, which aggregates every uncovered path into one prompt, falls back to the bare family whenever a command mixes a proven read with a proven write.
The grant is then wider than the prompt the user answered.

- **Smell:** Category C (a fact established at the decision point is discarded by the shape that carries it).
- **Target:** `src/session-approval.ts` carries `(surface, pattern)` pairs rather than one surface and a pattern list; `src/session-rules.ts`'s per-pattern loop reads the pair's own surface; `src/handlers/gates/bash-external-directory.ts` stops falling back to the family for a mixed-direction command.
- **Design question the step must settle:** `ForwardedSessionApproval` is written to a file another process reads, so the pair form either ships as a tolerated alternative shape the reader normalizes, or waits for a major.
- **Outcome:** approving `grep -r foo ~/dev > ~/other/out.txt` for the session grants a read under `~/dev` and a write to `~/other/out.txt`, not both directions on both; `grep -c 'ApprovalPattern'` on `session-approval.ts` goes 0 → ≥ 1.
- **Commit type:** `feat:`, or `feat!:` if the wire shape is not made tolerant — undecided at plan time.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 2 / Priority 12.**

Landed: the design question was settled the other way from how the step framed it.
The wire file turned out to be the *smaller* of the two breaks: `ForwardedSessionApproval` is structurally reachable from the published declaration bundle through `PromptPermissionDetails`, which is the type a third-party `Authorizer` chain link receives — so replacing its fields breaks a consumer at compile time whether or not two processes ever skew.
With tolerance no longer buying non-breaking status, the operator took the strictest shape: `grants: ApprovalGrant[]` alone, with the reader rejecting the pre-#810 shape rather than normalizing it.
Skew then drops the suggestion in both directions, which was verified against the published tag rather than assumed — `sessionApproval` is not in `readForwardedPermissionRequest`'s required set at v29.3.0, so the request is still accepted and still prompts, and the child still records its own narrow grant.
The cost is a lost whole-session scope option, never a wider grant.

The `Outcome:` line needs one correction a reader should not have to derive.
The relief is visible only when the uncovered paths sit in **different directories**: `deriveApprovalPattern` scopes a glob at the value's last separator, so `cat /outside/a.ts > /outside/b.ts` derives `/outside/*` for both tokens and its two directional grants reconstitute exactly what the bare family sugar-expands to.
That is correct — the user did approve a read and a write in that directory — and it has its own test so the no-op is documented rather than rediscovered.
The issue's own headline example holds because `~/dev` and `~/other/out.txt` do not share a directory.

One preparatory `refactor:` came out of the Tidy-First assessment: `PermissionGateResult`'s session-approval echo had no reader at all (`GateRunner` tested only `!== undefined`, and the runner's public `GateOutcome` carries no such field), so it collapsed to `canGrantForSession` in / `forSession` out first.
That deleted `toGateApproval()` and `representativePattern` — neither can name a single representative `(surface, pattern)` once an approval carries a surface per pattern — and kept the reshape commit out of `permission-gate.ts` entirely.
`SessionApproval.multiple` was dropped rather than kept beside the new `forGrants`, since both its production callers moved and a test-only constructor is a dead-code liability.

`grep -c 'ApprovalGrant' packages/pi-permission-system/src/session-approval.ts` is 4.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 11: The user chooses a session grant's direction width ([#813])

**Cause:** Step 2 narrows a bash session grant to the direction the gate proved, which is what the prompt named and what least privilege requires.
It also costs a prompt the user had no way to avoid: approving `echo hi > out.txt` for the session grants a write, so a following `cat out.txt` asks again.
The read-after-write flow is common, the second ask carries no new information, and the only remedy today is to answer it — the user cannot say "and reads too" at the moment they already have the context.

- **Smell:** Category C (a decision the user is qualified to make has no representation at the point they are asked).
- **Target:** the ask prompt offers a both-directions session grant beside the proven-direction one, and `src/handlers/gates/` records the chosen width; the narrow grant stays the default, so a user who never notices the second option is never granted more than the prompt named.
- **Design question the step must settle:** whether the choice is a second approve-for-session affordance or a modifier on the existing one — ADR 0011 caps what an ask may render, and a third session option competes for the same prompt real estate the evidence list uses.
- **Outcome:** approving `echo hi > ~/other/out.txt` at the wider width silences the following `cat ~/other/out.txt`; approving it at the default width still asks, and the review log's `decidedBy` names which width was chosen.
- **Commit type:** `feat:` — a new prompt affordance the user acts on.
- **Impact 2 / Risk 1 / Priority 10.**

Landed: the design question was settled as a second affordance — a conditional fifth option row, hotkey `b`, offered only when every grant in the approval proves the same direction.
The competing shape (a second step after `s`, reusing the forwarded scope-step machinery) was declined on measured frequency: over the six days since Step 2 landed, 40 of 107 distinct asks (37.4%) resolved on a directional surface, so a step would have cost a keystroke on more than a third of all session grants, and three steps on a forwarded one.
The same measurement settled symmetry the other way from the issue's framing: all 40 were `external_directory_read` and none were writes, so the read-after-write flow the issue names never occurred in the window while its mirror occurred throughout — the option is offered on either direction.

The `Outcome:` line needs one correction.
It promised the review log's `decidedBy` would name the chosen width, but `decidedBy` answers *who decided* and for a human ask is `{kind: "user", via}` with no room for a property of the grant.
The width is recorded as its own `sessionGrantWidth` field on the terminal review entry, which states `"proven"` explicitly rather than leaving a log reader to know the default.

The width travels as an optional field orthogonal to `PermissionDecisionState`, never as a new state value: read at the published tag, `readForwardedPermissionResponse` gates on `isPermissionDecisionState` and returns `null` for an unrecognized one, so a skewed child would have polled to the full ten-minute forwarding timeout rather than losing one field.
Both skew directions now land on `"proven"`.

Two residuals [#810] deferred here are paid off: the forwarded whole-session scope label named one grant out of several and now names their count, and `docs/session-approvals.md` documents grant direction now that the user chooses it.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 12: An unresolvable redirect proves nothing ([#814])

**Cause:** Step 2's operator table answers by operator spelling, and `redirectOperatorOf` reads whichever operator survives the parse — but tree-sitter-bash has no node for the read-write open `<>`, so it degrades to an `ERROR` whose placement depends on the destination's shape.
Measured on `main` against the real collector: `cat <> rw.txt` proves `read` and `cat <> ~/rw.txt` proves `write`.
The first is a fail-open in the one direction ADR 0013 §10 is careful about everywhere else, and the second makes the answer a function of the filename rather than the syntax.

- **Smell:** Category C (a proof is synthesized from a parse the parser itself did not resolve).
- **Target:** `src/access-intent/bash/redirect-analysis.ts` — refuse a redirect carrying an unresolved parse and return `UNPROVEN_EFFECT`, so the destination consults both directional surfaces per §10's base case, rather than guessing from a partial operator.
- **Constraint:** every currently-proven operator (`>`, `>>`, `>|`, `&>`, `&>>`, `<`, `<<<`, `2>&1`, `>& out`, `<& in`) keeps its answer; the change may only move an unresolvable form to unproven.
- **Outcome:** `cat <> rw.txt` and `cat <> ~/rw.txt` attribute the same effect, and it is not a bare `read`; the `it.fails` characterization test Step 3 left in `test/access-intent/bash/redirect-analysis.test.ts` flips to a plain assertion.
- **Commit type:** `fix:` (settled at plan time; see the `Landed:` note).
- **Impact 3 / Risk 1 / Priority 12.**

Landed: the fix is one predicate, `parseUnresolvedAt`, and the Target line named the wrong home for it.
It lives in `parser.ts`, not `redirect-analysis.ts`, because the sibling split is a fact about tree-sitter's **error recovery** rather than about redirects — `cat <> rw.txt` keeps the discarded `>` inside the redirect while `cat <> ~/rw.txt` strands the `<` ahead of one, and nothing inside the second node distinguishes it from a genuine `> ~/rw.txt`.
Reading `TSNode`'s new `hasError` / `previousSibling` only there keeps a later walker from hand-rolling a sibling chain of its own.
Consulting the immediate predecessor rather than the enclosing statement is what keeps the answer per redirect: `cat a > out.txt <> ~/rw.txt` errors as a statement while its first redirect is a fully resolved write.

Three things the step's bullets did not name.

The defect had a second instance in the *other* reader: `cat <>&1` parses to a redirect whose only children are the operator and a descriptor, so `redirectMayWriteFile`'s loop found nothing to refuse on and cleared the wrapper-floor exemption Step 3 built.
The up-front refusal is strictly stronger than the in-loop `ERROR` check it replaces, and that command is the case which distinguishes them.

The demotion is applied to a *proof* and never to the `null` a descriptor duplication answers, or `<>&1`'s bare `1` would be emitted as a path candidate.
Nothing pinned that ordering until a test called `redirectEffectForDestination` with a descriptor node directly — both production callers filter to `ARG_NODE_TYPES` first, so neither can reach the branch.

The accepted residual is about the **parse**, not about `<>`, so it is wider than the form that exposed it: any redirect whose own subtree or immediate predecessor carries an `ERROR` goes unproven, including one that is itself well-formed.
`cat $(( > out.txt` and `echo ) > out.txt` each carry a perfectly good `> out.txt` demoted because an unrelated recovery failure precedes it.
Both are pinned as tests so the width is deliberate rather than incidental, and the direction is the affordable one — over-refusing costs a prompt, under-refusing hands a write to a read grant.

The cost is measured, not argued, by `scripts/measure-unresolved-redirects.mjs`: of 5352 distinct intact bash commands in the author's review log, 2619 name a file through a redirect and **1** (0.019%) changes an attribution — `"tail"`: write → unproven in `git commit -F - <<'MSG' 2>&1 | tail -4`, the valid bash ADR 0013's 2026-08-29 amendment records the grammar cannot parse.
That one real occurrence is itself an instance of the wider residual rather than of `<>`, which is the clearest evidence that the residual is the honest way to state the change.
Its token is not path-shaped, so no command newly prompts, which is what made this `fix:` rather than `fix!:`.
The corpus contains no executed read-write open at all; the literal `<>` appears 13 times, every one as quoted text.

Release: independent

#### Step 13: Apply the package's own directory vocabulary to the 62 root files ([#837])

**Cause:** the package has an organizing vocabulary (`authority/`, `handlers/gates/`, `access-intent/bash/`, `presentation/`, `path/`) and stopped applying it — 42% of `src` files sit at the root, several with an unambiguous existing home (`path-normalizer`, `expand-home`, `normalize` → `path/`; `bash-arity`, `bash-advisory-check` → `access-intent/bash/`).
Past phases reorganized periodically but inconsistently and then lapsed, because the target layout was re-derived each time rather than recorded.

- **Smell:** Category C (a stated structure the code does not follow).
- **Target:** `packages/pi-permission-system/src/` — one-shot bulk move, plus the resulting layout written into this document's module tree so later work conforms rather than re-derives.
- **Constraint:** non-breaking (`refactor:`, not `refactor!:`) — `exports` declares only `.` → `src/service.ts`, and no deep import of this package exists in the repo; the `exports` map moves with the file if `service.ts` relocates.
  Intra-package imports use the eslint-enforced `#src/` alias, so every move is a mechanical specifier rewrite `tsc` verifies exhaustively.
  Needs a quiet trunk — file moves conflict badly with peer worktree sessions.
- **Outcome:** root-level `src/*.ts` drops from 62 to the entry points that belong there, the partition is documented in the module tree, and `pnpm run check` plus the full suite pass unchanged.
- **Commit type:** `refactor:`.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 2 / Priority 12.**

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 14: An unparsed bash subtree fails closed ([#840])

**Cause:** ADR 0013 §10's last combinator clause — "any unhandled node type: fail closed (`ask`, `unknown`)" — is unimplemented.
`resolveBashCommandCheck` fails closed only on a **zero-unit** parse (the `<unparseable-bash-command>` sentinel from [#452]); a *partial* failure emits the unparsed subtree's text as one ordinary unit, which the `bash:` patterns match like any string and a permissive fallback allows.
Step 4 makes that emission an explicit branch and deliberately stops there, because the floor is the fold's behavior rather than the enumerator's.

- **Smell:** Category C (a fail-open the model's own decision record already forbids).
- **Target:** a marker on `BashCommand` (`src/access-intent/bash/command-enumeration.ts`) set wherever the parse could not be resolved, read by `src/handlers/gates/bash-command.ts` to floor an `allow` to a synthetic `ask` beside the existing `WRAPPER_SENTINEL` entries.
  The floor is synthesized after the resolver returns, like the other three sentinels, so `resolveYoloGrant` still reconciles it ([#712]).
- **Constraint:** an explicit `deny`/`ask` on the unit is left untouched, as with the wrapper floors.
- **Outcome:** a subtree the fold did not understand can no longer ride the universal fallback; measured cost is 2 commands in 5269 intact review-log commands (0.038%).
  `grep -c '<unparsed' packages/pi-permission-system/src/handlers/gates/bash-command.ts` goes 0 → ≥ 1.
- **Commit type:** `fix:`.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 1 / Priority 15.**

Release: independent

Landed: the Target line named a trigger that fires **zero** times on real input, and measuring before designing is what caught it.
It said the marker is set on the `ERROR` branch Step 4 introduces.
Over 5269 intact deduplicated review-log commands, 2 have a parse error and **0** emit an `ERROR` node's text as a command unit — and the `ERROR`-emitting population is input `bash -n` rejects, which the shell never runs.
Both real cases are the grammar gap ADR 0013's 2026-08-29 amendment already named, where the `ERROR` sits under `heredoc_redirect → file_redirect`, an `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES` member never read for text.
The step's own `Outcome:` line counted `ERROR`-node *presence*, not units a floor on that branch would reach; the 1-in-4276 figure was right about the former and inapplicable to the latter.

So the trigger is the parse's health rather than a node type: `parseUnresolvedWithin` in `parser.ts` (subtree only — distinct from `parseUnresolvedAt`, whose predecessor clause is a fact about redirects), threaded through a third `UnitScope` field and skipped for `program`/`list`/`pipeline`, which report an error whenever anything anywhere beneath them failed.

Two things the bullets did not name.
The floor names the **whole** command, not the marked unit: `command` is the prompt value, the decision value, the review-log value, and the session-approval pattern at once, so naming `git commit -F` would both hide the text that failed to parse and record a grant covering any later command enumerating that fragment.
And the session-grant exemption needed no code — `GateRunner` tests `check.source === "session"` before it tests state, so spreading the resolved check carries a grant through; it was behavior nothing pinned, and now is.

The residual is enumeration rather than the verdict: a dropped command is consulted against no rule, so an explicit `deny` still does not fire and the floor converts silence into a reviewable prompt.
Tracked as [#875].

#### ✅ Step 15: A forwarded denial names what actually refused it ([#844])

**Cause:** Step 5 reconciles the `permissions:decision` broadcast with the stamped decider on every path, and reconciles the agent-facing denial text on one — the `authorizer` arm the issue reported.
A forwarded ask the parent's own rule denied, or one whose parent-side escalation threw, still renders through `renderUserDenial`, so after Step 5 the broadcast says `policy_deny` and the text says the user denied it, about the same request.

- **Smell:** Category C (a fact established at the decision point reaching one of its two consumers), the residual half of Step 5.
- **Target:** two more arms on `renderRefusal` (`src/presentation/agent-renderer.ts`).
  The `gate_error` arm is a render saying the permission authority failed to answer, with `decidedBy.reason` carrying the detail.
  The `rule` arm is the step's real work: the child's `PromptPayload.request.matchedPattern` is the pattern that raised the child's *ask*, not the parent's deny rule, so `renderPolicyDenial` would name the wrong rule and the parent's pattern and origin live only on the response's `decidedBy`.
- **Design question the step must settle:** whether a forwarded verdict may disclose the serving node's rule facts to the requesting agent (ADR 0011 §6), or whether the arm renders without naming a rule.
- **Outcome:** the two records agree on every forwarded path; `grep -c 'renderEscalatedPolicyDenial' packages/pi-permission-system/src/presentation/agent-renderer.ts` goes 0 → 2.
- **Commit type:** `fix:`.
- **Impact 2 / Risk 1 / Priority 8.**

Landed: the disclosure question the step was adopted to settle is answered in ADR 0011 §10 rather than in the plan — a forwarded refusal may name the deciding node's rule pattern, its deny-with-reason text, and an escalation's error text, and may say another session decided; the responder session id and the rule's `origin` scope stay withheld.
The deciding rule's pattern **replaces** the payload's in the sentence rather than joining it, because rendering both would state two rules where the agent needs the one that refused — so `identification` now takes its rule clause as a parameter, and the ask's own rule is named by `askRuleClause`.

Two things the Target line did not name.
The hop is **derived**, not assumed: `renderRefusal` keeps `decidedBy.kind === "forwarded"` alongside the unwrapped decider, so a `rule` or `gate_error` decided locally does not claim a serving session it never had — both arms are forwarding-only today, but the exhaustive switch has to answer for them anyway.
And the reason clause had no producer at all: `resolveDecision` built its denial literal by hand and never copied `check.reason`, so a serving node's deny-with-reason text stopped at the node holding the config.
Carrying it (through `createDeniedPermissionDecision`, which normalizes the reason and selects the state) is what gives the new render something to say; the wire field and its reader already existed.

The step's own `Outcome:` metric was replaced during planning: `grep -c 'case "rule"'` measured **1** at baseline, not the 0 the line predicted, because [#772]'s fall-through group already listed the label — it could not discriminate in either direction.

`grep -c 'renderEscalatedPolicyDenial' packages/pi-permission-system/src/presentation/agent-renderer.ts` is 2.

Release: independent

#### ✅ Step 16: A path named as a statement's own operand reaches the path surfaces ([#839])

**Cause:** the bash path collector reads token text only from `command` and `file_redirect` nodes, so a path a statement names directly — a `for`/`select` word-list entry, a `case` subject — is a child of the statement node and reaches neither the `path` nor the `external_directory` surface.
The loop body cannot recover it: `cat $f` carries only the unexpanded `$f`, which ADR 0009 declines to resolve, so the word list is the sole place the literal appears and `for f in ~/other/secret; do cat $f; done` reads outside the working directory with no prompt.
Step 4 closed the command surface's half of this family; this is the member that is not a command at all.

- **Smell:** Category C (a boundary flaw with a user-visible fail-open).
- **Target:** two node-type branches in `src/access-intent/bash/token-collection.ts`'s `collectPathCandidateTokens`, feeding one private walker parameterized by which side of the anonymous `in` keyword carries the operands — a `for`/`select` word list follows it, a `case` subject precedes it.
  A `case` pattern, a loop variable, and a function's own name stay unread, so the command surface's `STATEMENT_TYPES` filter and the path surface's operand read draw the same boundary from opposite sides.
  No resolver change: `BashPathResolver.walkForCandidates` already routes both node types through its `default:` branch.
- **Design question the step must settle:** what effect a statement operand carries, since neither proof source can speak for it — no command word owns it and no redirect operator names it.
- **Outcome:** `for f in /etc/shadow; do cat $f; done` yields `["/etc/shadow"]` from both `pathRuleCandidates()` and `externalAccesses()` where it yielded `[]`; `grep -cE 'for_statement|case_statement' packages/pi-permission-system/src/access-intent/bash/token-collection.ts` goes 0 → ≥ 2.
- **Commit type:** `fix!:`.
- **Impact 4 / Risk 3 / Priority 12.**

Landed: the design question settled as `UNPROVEN_EFFECT`, the fail-closed base case — the gates consult both directional surfaces most-restrictive, so a `path_read: allow` alone does not silence a `for`-list operand.
Deriving a direction from the loop body was not available: the body reaches the token only through `$f`.

Three properties of the walk carry the safety argument and are each pinned by a named mutation.
A non-operand child falls through to the **ordinary recursion**, not to a hosted-execution search — otherwise the `do_group` stops reaching the loop body's commands entirely.
An operand-side child outside `ARG_NODE_TYPES` does the same, so a substitution in the word list is descended rather than read as literal text and keeps its own command's [#807] attribution.
An operand-side argument node is both read and searched for hosted executions, the pairing a redirect destination already gets.

One mutation behaved differently from the plan's prediction, and the difference is the finding: flipping the `case` operand side to `after-in` kills the subject pins but **not** the pattern pins, because a `case_item` is not an argument node and the ordinary recursion reads no `word` text — two independent facts protect the pattern, and the one that does is the `ARG_NODE_TYPES` guard.

Measured by `scripts/measure-statement-operands.mjs` (2026-09-02) over the local review log: 132 `for_statement` nodes contributing 343 argument-typed operand words, and exactly one `case_statement`, whose subject `":$PATH:"` is not path-shaped — so the `for` half carries the entire blast radius and the `case` half is hardening.
Diffing real `BashProgram.parse` output across a spike of the change over 5191 intact commands: 22 (0.42%) change `pathRuleCandidates()`, 11 (0.21%) change `externalAccesses()`, and 3 (0.058%) newly prompt under a real policy, with none ceasing to prompt.
That non-zero prompt count is why this shipped `fix!:` where Step 4 shipped `fix:`.

`grep -cE 'for_statement|case_statement' packages/pi-permission-system/src/access-intent/bash/token-collection.ts` is 2.

Release: independent

```

The dashed edges are sequencing preferences, not dependencies.
Steps 7 and 8 both touch the cross-node reading surface, and Step 7's alarm needs the same parent-side lookup Step 8's mechanism A would introduce — landing Step 7 first tells Step 8 whether that surface already exists.
Steps 10 and 11 both write a session grant from a bash gate: Step 10 decides whether one approval can carry two surfaces, which is the shape Step 11's wider width would be recorded in, so landing Step 10 first tells Step 11 what it is choosing between.
Steps 4 and 16 close the two halves of the same bypass family from opposite surfaces, and Step 4 settled the statement vocabulary Step 16's operand read mirrors — landing Step 4 first means Step 16 draws its boundary against a written one rather than inventing both.

### Parallel tracks

- **Track A — the capability axis:** Steps 1 → 2 → 3, strictly sequential.
  Step 2 needs the directional surfaces to route a proven effect to, and Step 3 needs the pure-reader core Step 2 defines.
  This track owns `src/access-intent/bash/` and `src/handlers/gates/`.
- **Track B — bash enumeration completeness:** Steps 4 → 14, in that order, with Step 16 beside them.
  Step 14 reads the `ERROR` branch Step 4 introduces, so it cannot precede it.
  Step 16 has no such dependency — it is the path surface's half of the same family, and Step 4 merely settled the statement vocabulary it mirrors from the other side.
  The track touches `command-enumeration.ts`, `nested-execution.ts`, `token-collection.ts`, and `handlers/gates/bash-command.ts`, which Track A's Steps 2 and 3 also read — land it before Step 2 or after Step 3, not concurrently.
- **Track C — decision attribution:** Steps 5 → 15, in that order; Step 15 adds arms to the `renderRefusal` dispatch Step 5 introduces, so it cannot precede it.
  The track touches `permission-events.ts`, `runner.ts`, `gates/helpers.ts`, `permission-gate.ts`, and `presentation/agent-renderer.ts`, and Track A's tidy-first prep splits `runDescriptor` in the same file — sequence it against Step 2 rather than running both at once.
- **Track D — cross-node contract residuals:** Steps 6, 7, 8, disjoint from every other track (`service.ts`, `service-lifecycle.ts`, `authority/subagent-registry.ts`, `tool-access-extractor-registry.ts`).
- **Track E — config-schema ergonomics:** Step 9, after Step 1 has converted `permissionSchema` to a named-property object; it touches `config-schema.ts` and the generated JSON Schema, which no other step edits once Step 1 has landed.
- **Track F — session-approval width:** Steps 10 and 11, after Step 2 has proven a direction to record.
  Step 10 touches `session-approval.ts`, `session-rules.ts`, and the forwarded-approval wire, which Track A leaves alone; Step 11 touches the ask prompt and the gates that build a `SessionApproval`, so it reads Step 10's shape rather than competing for it.

### Release batches

- **Batch "capability-axis":** Steps 1, 2, 3 (ship together; tail = Step 3; release vehicle = Step 3's `fix:` for [#803], with Step 1's `feat:` for the new config keys riding the same release — Step 2 is a hidden `refactor:` on its own).
  The batch ships together because Steps 1 and 2 relieve nothing a user can observe until a directional grant exists to write, while Step 3's relief is immediate and unconditional.
- Independently releasable: Step 4 (`fix:`), Step 14 (`fix:`), Step 16 (`fix!:` — it newly prompts on `external_directory` for 3 of 5191 measured real commands, where Step 4's half changed no path candidate at all), Step 5 (`feat!:` — the operator settled the bump note as breaking), Step 15 (`fix:`), Step 7 (`feat:`), Step 8 (`feat:` — mechanism B landed), Step 9 (`feat:` — the generated schema ships in the tarball, so new completions and hover text are user-observable), Step 10 (`feat!:` — the wire shape was not made tolerant, and the type is reachable from the published declaration bundle), Step 11 (`feat:` — a new prompt affordance the user acts on).
- Step 6 cuts no release on its own: its deliverable is an ADR amendment (`docs:`, hidden), and any code it schedules lands in a later step or a later phase.
