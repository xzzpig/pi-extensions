# Retro: #992 — a computed argument can spell a find/fd/sort withdrawing option the retraction guard never sees

## Stage: Planning (2026-09-29T19:41:37Z)

### Session summary

Planned a leading-dash rule: a computed argument withdraws `find`/`fd`/`sort`'s read claim only when it may reach the program as a word beginning with `-`, carried as a new required `ArgWord.mayLeadWithDash`.
A preparatory fix makes a `tree-sitter-bash` `number` node spelled exactly.
Filed [#995] (reassigned `$HOME`/`$PWD`) and placed it as the Phase 15 step after #992.

### Observations

- A corpus spike (70,961 unique bash commands from 1,867 session transcripts plus the review log, real `getParser()` and `proveCommandEffect`) measured newly withdrawn `find` units: 625 under the issue's any-computed rule, 165 once digits are exact, and 96 under the adopted rule.
  Of these, the number with external-looking operands was 17 under the middle rule and 3 under the adopted one.
- The unexpected finding: `isSpelledExactly` answers `false` for a `number` node, so `-maxdepth 2` is "computed" and alone caused 460 of the 625.
  This is latent in `sed`/`awk` already (1 `awk` unit in the corpus).
- Operator decisions: the leading-dash rule (not any-computed, not per-guard option-value grammar); fold the digit fix as a leading step; `fix!:` with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (the roadmap said `fix:`), on [#609]'s newly-prompts precedent.
- The operator asked what an end user would notice before deciding: the answer was new prompts on benign reads (`find "$dir" -name x` against an external `$dir` under a split read/write config), since none of the 96 withdrawn units in the corpus actually wrote.
- Found while checking the rule's inputs: `resolvePlainVariableExpansion` resolves `$HOME` to `os.homedir()` even after `HOME=-delete;`, confirmed through `BashProgram.parse` (`find "$HOME"` projects a core read of the home directory).
  Filed as [#995]; the tilde form was not confirmed on macOS bash.
- The Tidy-First assessor's recommendation to switch `node-text.test.ts`'s exact table from `toEqual` to `toMatchObject` was declined (it weakens the assertion); the plan adds the new field to the expected objects instead.
  Its shared `literalArgWords` builder became TDD step 1.
- The prototype predicate's outcomes over 24 argument shapes are recorded in the plan's Design Overview, so the TDD step's cases and killing mutations are observed, not predicted.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-09-29T21:13:01Z)

### Session summary

All five planned steps landed (shared `literalArgWords` builder, the digit fix, `ArgWord.mayLeadWithDash`, the `fix!:` guard change, docs), followed by three reviewer-driven fixes for words that split inside double quotes, each with its own docs commit.
The `pi-permission-system` suite went from 4992 to 5045 tests (+53).
Mid-session, at the operator's request, the three subagent definitions and two Explore-dispatch instructions moved to `claude-sonnet-5-5` (`chore:` commit), and the stale `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` entry left `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`'s `enabledModels`.

### Observations

- Deviation, step 2: a bare digit is not a collected path token (`sed -n 1p 2` collects nothing), so the observable test became `sed -n 1p 2 /etc/hosts`, where the digit withdrew `sed`'s claim over `/etc/hosts`.
- Deviation, step 3: the planned `sed` invariant pin (`"x$range"`, `mayLeadWithDash: false`) survived its mutation, because the script grammar withdraws a value spelled that way anyway; the pin now uses `p`, a script the grammar proves, so only the computed flag can withdraw it.
- Several step-3 killing mutations killed fewer rows than the plan named: the splitting check and the leading-character check overlap on `""$x`, `$A`, `$(…)`, and backticks, so each mutation removes only one of two independent reasons.
- Step 4's real-parse expectations had to list every collected token: `find` and `sort` collect their option words and computed operands too, not just the path.
- Pre-completion reviewer, round 1 (WARN): a quoted `"x$@"` / `"x${arr[@]}"` splits per element and only the first word carries the literal prefix.
  Fixed in `fix(pi-permission-system): a quoted "$@" after a literal withdraws find's, fd's, and sort's read claim`.
- Round 2 (WARN): an indirect `"x${!a}"` with `a='arr[@]'` splits with no `@` in its text.
  Fixed in `fix(pi-permission-system): a quoted indirect expansion after a literal withdraws find's, fd's, and sort's read claim`.
- Round 3 (WARN): any quoted variable may be a nameref (`declare -n s='arr[@]'`), so `"x$s"` splits on bash 5.3.
  The operator chose to close it rather than document it; measured over the planning corpus it withdraws 3 more `find` units of 2,025, and no command in the corpus declares a nameref.
  Fixed in `fix(pi-permission-system): a quoted variable after a literal withdraws find's, fd's, and sort's read claim`, which reverses the plan's headline example: `find /src -name "x$y"` now withdraws.
- Round 4 (WARN, non-blocking): stale `"x$y"` claims in the plan, answered with an implementation note in the plan; and `~` follows the inherited `HOME` (`HOME=-h bash -c 'printf ~'` prints `-h`), recorded on [#995] as part of its trust boundary rather than widened here.
- The quoted-splitting gap recurred three times because the plan's predicate enumerated splitting by node shape; each round found a bash feature (`$@`, indirection, namerefs) where the shape does not reveal the word count.
  A rule stated as "every quoted parameter expansion may split" from the start would have been one round.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-09-29T21:28:25Z)

### Session summary

One session ran all four stages on trunk: planning, TDD (five planned steps plus three reviewer-driven fixes), ship (`pi-permission-system-v36.0.0`, a major), and this retro.
`find`, `fd`, and `sort` now withdraw their read claim on a computed argument that may reach the program beginning with `-`, including any quoted parameter expansion, since `$@`, `${!name}`, and namerefs split inside double quotes.
Mid-TDD, at the operator's request, the subagents moved to `claude-sonnet-5-5`.

### Observations

#### What went well

- Widening the corpus from the review log to every `bash` tool call in `~/.pi/agent/sessions/*.jsonl` (70,961 unique commands, against the review log's asks and approvals only) measured every number a gate needed, including the round-3 decision: closing the nameref gap cost 3 `find` units of 2,025, which made the sound option an easy call.
  The review log alone cannot price a change that newly prompts, because it holds few of the commands the gate allowed silently.
- The planning spike found the `number`-node defect (460 of 625 would-be withdrawals caused by `-maxdepth 2`) before any design was settled, so it became a leading step instead of a regression.
- The operator's "what will the end user notice?"
  question produced the framing that decided the breaking-change call: the fix's visible effect is new prompts on benign reads, not blocked writes.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `premature-convergence` — `mayLeadWithDash` enumerated word splitting by parse-tree node shape (unquoted expansions split; a `string` does not), and the planning prototype shared the assumption, so it could only confirm it.
  Three reviewer rounds each found a bash feature whose word count the node shape does not reveal: quoted `"x$@"`, an indirect `"x${!a}"`, and a nameref `declare -n s='arr[@]'`; a fourth found `~` following an inherited `HOME`.
  Impact: three `fix:` commits, three `docs:` commits, three extra reviewer dispatches, and the plan's headline example (`find /src -name "x$y"` reads) reversed after an operator gate.
  Deriving the predicate from the bash manual's expansion rules rather than the grammar would have reached "every quoted parameter expansion may split" in one step.
- `missing-context` — two TDD test designs in the plan were not run through the real collector: a bare digit is never a collected token (`sed -n 1p 2` collects nothing), and `find`/`sort` collect their option words and computed operands too.
  Impact: two red runs rewritten before Green, no rework to shipped code.
- `instruction-violation` (self-identified) — an `Edit` body carried `\u2014` into a `command-effects.ts` doc comment, the same slip #924's retro recorded.
  Impact: one repair edit before commit.
- `other` — the round-3 delta dispatch listed "check/lint/fallow/full test green at `7d875c37`" in its prompt, and the reviewer reported those checks from the prompt instead of running them; round 2 also misread the root summary line (267) as the package's test count.
  Impact: two review rounds whose deterministic sections were not independent evidence; round 4, told to run them itself, did.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- The first planning gate led with mechanism and a measurement table; the operator had to ask what an end user would notice before choosing.
  The `clarification-gates` rule to name where behavior differs and where it does not already covers this, so it is a salience miss rather than a missing rule.
- The model-reference update arrived mid-red-step; committing only the model files by pathspec and finishing the fix before the reviewer dispatch kept both changes clean, at the cost of one reload pause.

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation**: planning, TDD, and this retro ran on `claude-opus-5-5` (205 assistant turns), and ship on `claude-sonnet-5-5` (13), which suits the scripted flow.
  The `tidy-first-assessor` and round-1 `pre-completion-reviewer` ran on `claude-sonnet-5` (2 min and 12 min); rounds 2–4 ran on `claude-sonnet-5-5` (2, 1, and 3 min).
  The faster rounds still found real gaps, but rounds 2 and 3 were sloppy on the deterministic section (a misread count, skipped checks), which the dispatch prompt invited.
- **Feedback-loop gap analysis**: `check` ran after every interface-changing step and the bash test directory before every commit; the full suite ran after each fix round.

### Changes made

1. `.pi/skills/package-pi-permission-system/SKILL.md`: a guard-skipping bash predicate is derived from bash's expansion rules, not node shapes, naming the four cases this issue's reviews found.
2. `packages/pi-permission-system/docs/architecture/investigating-a-report.md`: a change that newly prompts is priced against the session transcripts, with the `jq` recipe that produced this issue's corpus.
3. `.pi/skills/pre-completion/SKILL.md`: a delta dispatch never states the dispatcher's own check results.
