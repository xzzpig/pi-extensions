/**
 * Schema for a single credential file/directory entry.
 *
 * `mode: "mask"` without `extract` is **whole-file** masking: the entire
 * file content is replaced inside the sandbox with one sentinel string,
 * and the proxy substitutes that sentinel back to the real bytes on egress.
 * This works for files whose content *is* the credential (a token file, a
 * single-line secret).
 *
 * `mode: "mask"` with `extract` is **structured** masking: the regex is
 * applied globally to the real file, capture group 1 of each match is a
 * credential value, and only those captured spans are replaced with
 * sentinels — the rest of the file is preserved byte-for-byte. This lets a
 * tool that parses the file (`.netrc`, JSON/YAML configs) still succeed
 * inside the sandbox while the credential values are protected. If the
 * pattern matches nothing, behaviour is governed by `onExtractNoMatch`
 * (default `"warn"` — the file is left readable as-is and a stderr
 * warning is emitted).
 *
 * `mode: "mask"` with `decode: "jwt"` extends structured masking into
 * encoded values: where `extract` opens plain text to mask a span inside
 * it, `decode` opens the encoding so masking can target fields inside the
 * decoded payload (`maskClaims`):
 *
 * - **Default pattern**: when `extract` is absent, a built-in JWT regex is
 *   used (every JWT starts `eyJ` — base64url of `{"`), so authors don't
 *   hand-write it. An explicit `extract` wins; its group-1 captures are the
 *   candidates.
 * - **Decode-verification**: each candidate must actually BE a JWT (three
 *   segments, JSON header/payload, `alg` in the header) before it is
 *   masked; candidates failing verification are left untouched.
 * - **Claim-level masking** (`maskClaims`): each named top-level payload
 *   claim present with a string value is replaced by its own sentinel and
 *   the token is rebuilt around the modified payload (original header,
 *   filler signature). All other claims stay real, so a client that
 *   decodes the token and reads a non-secret claim keeps working. The
 *   proxy substitutes both the whole rebuilt token (sent as a bearer
 *   credential) and each claim sentinel (extracted and sent alone).
 * - **Whole-token fallback** (no `maskClaims`): the whole decoded value is
 *   treated as the credential — for bearer-style usage where the token
 *   itself is the secret — and replaced with a structurally valid fake JWT
 *   (parseable header/payload, far-future `exp`), so client-side token
 *   parsing inside the sandbox doesn't break. Its header declares
 *   `alg: HS256` (not `alg: none`, which misconfigured validators accept)
 *   with a garbage signature, so any validator the unswapped fake reaches
 *   rejects it.
 * - **No verified candidate**: if nothing matches, no candidate verifies,
 *   or (with `maskClaims`) no named claim matches in any verified token,
 *   behaviour is governed by `onExtractNoMatch` — same as a non-matching
 *   `extract` (default `"warn"`: stderr warning, file left readable
 *   as-is).
 *
 * `maskDuplicates: true` (only meaningful with `extract` or `decode`)
 * additionally replaces every verbatim occurrence of each masked value
 * *outside* the regex-matched spans — for a secret repeated where the
 * regex does not reach (e.g. pasted into a comment). The scan is raw
 * substring matching, so a short or common captured value may also hit
 * unrelated content that happens to contain it; intended for long,
 * high-entropy secrets. Composed with `decode`, only captures that passed
 * verification are scanned — a duplicate is the same value and reuses the
 * verified capture's fake without re-verification.
 *
 * On macOS, SBPL cannot redirect reads, so `mode: "mask"` (with or without
 * `extract`/`decode`) currently degrades to `mode: "deny"` (the file is
 * unreadable inside the sandbox).
