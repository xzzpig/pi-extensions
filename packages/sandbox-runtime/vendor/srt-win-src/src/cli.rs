//! `srt-win` CLI dispatch — exposed as a library entry point so an
//! embedding multicall binary can link the crate and route to it when
//! `argv[1] == `[`SRT_WIN_DISPATCH_ARG1`] instead of shipping a
//! separate `srt-win.exe`. Dispatch keys on `argv[1]`, not `argv[0]`:
//! Windows cannot preserve a spoofed `argv[0]` across
//! `CreateProcessWithLogonW` / `ShellExecuteExW(runas)`, so a
//! Unix-style multicall-on-argv0 would lose the route on every
//! internal re-spawn. The standalone binary (`main.rs`) is a
//! one-line shim over [`run_from_args`].
//!
//! Subcommands:
//!   install | uninstall                — provision/remove the
//!                                         `srt-sandbox` user account +
//!                                         user-SID-keyed WFP filters
//!                                         (one UAC prompt)
//!   user   status | read-cred | trust-ca — inspect the sandbox user
//!   wfp    status | verify | uninstall — inspect/probe/remove WFP filters
//!   acl    stamp | grant | restore | revoke | recover
//!                                       — additive sandbox-user ACEs
//!   exec   -- <target> [args...]       — spawn under the two-hop
//!                                         sandbox-user lockdown
//!
//! `status` subcommands write one line of JSON to stdout and exit 0.
//! Mutating subcommands require elevation and write human-readable
//! progress to stderr. `exec` propagates the child's exit code.
//!
//! Several arms call `std::process::exit` directly (exec's child
//! propagation, install's structured exit codes, self-elevate's
//! cancel path). [`run_from_args`] therefore returns the exit code
//! only for the fall-through (`Ok` → 0, `Err` → 1) cases; an
//! embedder must be prepared for the process to exit from inside the
//! dispatch.

// Re-alias so paths from this file's prior life as the [[bin]]
// crate root (`srt_win::…`) keep resolving now that it's a lib
// module.
