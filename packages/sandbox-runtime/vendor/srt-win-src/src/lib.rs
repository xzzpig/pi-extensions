//! `srt-win` — Windows network sandbox helper for sandbox-runtime.
//!
//! This crate is the Rust half of the Windows backend. The library
//! exposes the SID, group, and WFP primitives so they can be unit-
//! tested, plus the full CLI dispatch as [`run_from_args`] so an
//! embedding multicall binary can link the crate directly. The
//! `srt-win` binary (`main.rs`) is a one-line shim over that entry
//! point.
//!
//! Windows-only. Building on other platforms yields an empty crate so
//! `cargo check` from a non-Windows host doesn't error.
