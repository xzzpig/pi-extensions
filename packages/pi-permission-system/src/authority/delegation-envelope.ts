/**
 * The bounded-delegation enforcement checkpoint (ADR 0007 §5).
 *
 * The chain owner caps every registered link's verdict so a buggy or over-eager
 * external judge can never exceed the operator's policy: a link's `allow` on an
 * excluded surface is downgraded to `defer`, letting the `ask` fall through to
 * the terminal (a prompt) instead. The checkpoint only ever *tightens* a
 * verdict — it never turns a `defer`/`deny` into an `allow`.
 *
 * The excluded set is the whole `path` surface plus `external_directory`. A
 * finer secret-shaped-`path` exclusion (letting a link allow a non-secret path)
 * is deferred to the allow-capable slice that needs it (#620); until then the
 * conservative whole-surface exclusion ships. The checkpoint is dormant while
 * the only registered links are deny-first (they never `allow`).
