 * symlink-resolved (canonical) path instead of the typed (lexical) path,
 * defeating a configured `/tmp/*` allow.
 *
 * `AccessPath` makes the misuse a compile error:
 * - {@link matchValues} returns `string[]` — the lexical alias union ∪ canonical,
 *   for `external_directory` pattern matching.
 * - {@link boundaryValue} returns `string` — the canonical form, for
 *   outside-CWD containment and infra-read checks.
 * - {@link value} returns `string` — the lexical absolute form, for display,
 *   approval patterns, decision values, and logs.
 * - {@link resolvedAlias} returns `string | undefined` — the canonical form
 *   only when it names a location distinct from the lexical form, for
 *   disclosing a symlink target in a prompt or denial message.
 *
 * Construct via {@link forPath} (resolved, with optional cd-folded base),
 * {@link forNativeTarget} (the file a built-in Pi tool opens), or
 * {@link forLiteral} (literal-only, for an unknown base); the constructor is
