/**
 * The tool-surface region of a system prompt: which tools this session may
 * call, and the guidance those tools contribute.
 *
 * Pi writes that region near the top of its preamble, a few hundred characters
 * in. `@gotgenes/pi-subagents` copies everything ahead of the skills catalogue
 * into a child's prompt verbatim, so the child's leading bytes match its
 * parent's for prefix-reusing inference engines — which means editing the
 * region in place ends that shared prefix for every child whose allowed set
 * differs from its parent's (#890).
 *
 * So the region is *relocated* rather than narrowed: the sections Pi wrote are
 * removed, and this node's own are rendered at the end of the prompt, past
 * everything a child inherits. Each session then states its own tool surface
 * and no session edits another's bytes.
 *
 * Removal is bounded to the text this package or Pi wrote. The prompt is split
 * at the cwd layer Pi writes last and unconditionally: a
 * `Current working directory:` footer through Pi 0.85, a `<cwd>` section from
 * 0.86. Everything after it was appended by an extension, and everything
 * before it is Pi's own only when Pi did not build the prompt from a
 * `customPrompt`. Under a custom prompt Pi writes no tool surface at all, so a
 * section matched above the cwd layer is a user's or another extension's, and
 * removing it destroyed their text (#919, #932). On the 0.86 shape even a
 * Pi-authored head is searched only for Pi's own `<tools>` and `<rules>`,
 * bounded to where Pi writes them, since the plain headers it no longer
 * writes would match only a context file's text.
 *
 * Rendering follows `buildSystemPrompt`'s own rules (a tool is listed only
 * when it has a snippet; the guideline bullets are the allowed tools' own
 * `promptGuidelines`, then other extensions' rules, around Pi's built-in
 * ones) and its shape (plain headers or tagged sections, matching the
 * prompt), so the block reads as the one Pi would have written for this
 * session's real surface.
