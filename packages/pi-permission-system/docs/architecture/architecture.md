# Architecture

This document describes the internal design of the permission system, informed by [OpenCode's permission model](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/).

## Design principles

1. **Unified rule model** - one `Rule` type, one evaluation function, all surfaces.
2. **Pure evaluation** - permission decisions are pure functions of (surface, pattern, rules).
   IO stays at the edges.
3. **Session approvals are just more rules** - no separate matching engine, no separate pre-check.
4. **MCP stays special** - multi-name target derivation is pre-processing, not a special evaluation path.
5. **Defaults are rules** - the universal default (`permission["*"]`) is synthesized as a low-priority rule in the array.
   No side-channel fallbacks.
6. **Flat config format** - the flat `permission: { ... }` object where each key is a surface.
   The config IS the ruleset in human-friendly form.
7. **Preserve the two-phase model** - tool filtering (before_agent_start) and invocation gating (tool_call) remain separate.
8. **Ask = cache miss** - "ask" is the absence of a matching rule.
   The human is the oracle.
   Their decision is a rule.
   Persistence determines lifetime (once / session / config).
9. **Single-agent core, multi-agent by extension** - Pi is single-agent by deliberate design; the notion of multiple named agents is introduced entirely by external extensions (pi-subagents, pi-agent-router, some MasuRii packages), not by Pi itself.
   Per-agent `permission:` frontmatter is therefore an extension bridge layered on this single-agent core, not a core responsibility.
   The package learns the active agent from a generic `<active_agent>` signal (a system-prompt tag or an `active_agent` session entry), never from a hard dependency on any one multi-agent extension, so the bridge works with any tool that emits the signal.

## Core data model

### Rule

```typescript
/**
 * Provenance of a rule - which source contributed it.
 *
 * Config scopes: "global", "project", "agent", "project-agent".
 * Synthesized:   "builtin" (universal default / evaluate() fallback),
 *                "baseline" (conditional MCP metadata auto-allow).
 * Runtime:       "session" (session approvals).
 * Rewrite:       "yolo" (composition-stage ask→allow rewrite under yolo mode),
 *                "fail-closed" (composition-stage allow→ask floor when an
 *                invalid non-global config scope is detected).
 */
type RuleOrigin =
  | "global"
  | "project"
  | "agent"
  | "project-agent"
  | "builtin"
  | "baseline"
  | "session"
  | "yolo"
  | "fail-closed";

interface Rule {
  /** The permission surface: "bash", "edit", "mcp", "skill", "external_directory", "path", etc. */
  surface: string;
  /** The match pattern: a command glob, tool name, file path, skill name, or "*". */
  pattern: string;
  /** The decision. */
  action: PermissionState;
  /** Custom denial reason for deny rules (optional). */
  reason?: string;
  /**
   * Origin layer - used to derive PermissionCheckResult.source after evaluation.
   * Not used by evaluate(); purely informational metadata.
   */
  layer?: "default" | "baseline" | "config" | "session";
  /** Which source contributed this rule. */
  origin: RuleOrigin;
}
```

Every config entry, default policy, session approval, and agent override normalizes into `Rule[]`.

### Ruleset

```typescript
type Ruleset = Rule[];
```

Merge precedence is array ordering.
The synthesized universal default goes first (lowest priority), then MCP baseline auto-allow rules, then config rules (global → project → agent → project-agent), and finally session rules (highest priority).
Last-match-wins: `evaluate()` scans from the end.

### Evaluate

```typescript
function evaluate(
  surface: string,
  value: string,
  rules: Ruleset,
  platform: NodeJS.Platform,
): Rule {
  for (let i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const rule = rules[i];
    // On win32 a path-surface match folds case + separators; `platform` is
    // injected from `PermissionManager` (read once at the composition root,
    // #510), never `process.platform` ambiently.
    if (ruleMatches(rule, surface, value, platform)) {
      return rule;
    }
  }
  // Unreachable when defaults are synthesized - the catch-all always matches.
  return { surface, pattern: value, action: "ask" };
}
```

The entire decision engine.
When defaults are synthesized into the array, the catch-all `{ surface: "*", pattern: "*", action: "ask" }` always matches - the fallback return is defensive only.

## Composed ruleset

All rule sources are concatenated into a single flat array.
Index position determines priority (higher index wins):

```

`synthesizeDefaults()` produces a single universal catch-all from `permission["*"]`.
Per-surface catch-alls (e.g. `bash: { "*": "allow" }`) are expressed as regular config rules via `normalizeFlatConfig()` - no separate override layer is needed.

`synthesizeBaseline()` conditionally emits MCP metadata auto-allow rules.

`composeRuleset()` concatenates: defaults + baseline + config rules.
Session rules are concatenated after config rules so `evaluate()` handles them via last-match-wins - no separate per-branch pre-check.

### Default synthesis

```typescript
// Single universal catch-all from permission["*"].
function synthesizeDefaults(universalDefault: PermissionState): Ruleset {
  return [
    { surface: "*", pattern: "*", action: universalDefault, layer: "default" },
  ];
}

// MCP metadata auto-allow - only synthesized when any config rule has
// surface: "mcp" && action: "allow".
function synthesizeBaseline(configRules: Ruleset): Ruleset { ... }

// Concat in priority order: defaults, baseline, config.
function composeRuleset(defaults, baseline, config): Ruleset {
  return [...defaults, ...baseline, ...config];
}
```

```

The `Agent frontmatter` input (`AF`) is the per-agent override layer.
It only carries data when an external multi-agent extension is active (see design principle 9): the package resolves the active agent's name from a generic `<active_agent>` signal, then reads the `permission:` sub-document of that agent's definition file at `<cwd>/.pi/agents/<name>.md` (project) or `<agentDir>/agents/<name>.md` (global).
The package does not discover or enumerate agents — it reads one sub-document by name, on demand — and the `<cwd>/.pi/agents` location is a Pi platform convention this package encodes independently (no dependency on pi-subagents, ADR 0002).

## Config format

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "*": "ask",
    "read": "allow",
    "bash": { "*": "allow", "git *": "allow", "npm *": "allow", "rm *": "deny" },
    "mcp": { "*": "ask", "exa:*": "allow" },
    "skill": { "*": "ask", "librarian": "allow" },
    "path": { "*": "allow", "*.env": "deny" },
    "external_directory": "ask"
  }
}
```

Each top-level key in `permission` is a surface name.
A string value is shorthand for `{ "*": action }` (surface-level catch-all).
An object value maps patterns to actions.
`permission["*"]` is the universal fallback.

### Normalization to Rule[]

`normalizeFlatConfig` (`src/normalize.ts`) flattens each `permission` entry into `Rule`s: a string value expands to a single surface catch-all (`{ surface, pattern: "*", action }`), and an object value expands each `pattern → action` pair to one `Rule`.

## MCP pre-processing

MCP is the one surface that requires pre-processing **before** evaluation.
The multi-name target derivation stays, but it feeds candidate values into `evaluate()` rather than a separate code path:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Input["MCP tool call input"] --> Derive["createMcpTargets(input)"]
    Derive --> Candidates["[exa_search, exa:search, exa, search, mcp_call]"]
    Candidates --> Loop{"For each candidate"}
    Loop --> Eval["evaluate('mcp', candidate, rules)"]
    Eval --> Found{"Explicit match?"}
    Found -->|Yes| Return["Return rule"]
    Found -->|No| Next["Next candidate"]
    Next --> Loop
    Loop -->|Exhausted| Fallback["evaluate('mcp', '*', rules)<br/>(hits synthesized default)"]
```

The priority ordering of candidates is preserved.
The evaluation function is unchanged - MCP just calls it multiple times with different values.
MCP target derivation helpers live in `src/access-intent/mcp-targets.ts`.
Input normalization for all surfaces lives in `src/access-intent/input-normalizer.ts`.

### Path-bearing tool normalization

Per-tool path patterns — e.g. `"read": { "*": "allow", "*.env": "deny" }` — are evaluated via the `access-path` intent the per-tool gate emits ([#502]).
When the pipeline calls `resolvePerToolCheck`, a present `input.path` triggers `normalizer.forPath(path)` and an `access-path` intent on the tool-name surface; the resolver unwraps it to `path-values` carrying the lexical ∪ canonical alias set before the manager evaluates the rule.
When `input.path` is missing or empty, the pipeline falls back to a `tool` intent, which `normalizeInput` collapses to `["*"]` (surface catch-all).
Path alias derivation (home-expansion, cwd-relative aliases) lives in `getPathPolicyValues` / `AccessPath` — not in `normalizeInput`, which no longer touches path surfaces (#504).
`getToolPermission()` is unaffected — it always evaluates with `"*"` to determine whether to inject the tool at agent start.

The cross-cutting `path` and `external_directory` gates extract paths for **extension and MCP tools too** (#352): `describePathGate` and `describeExternalDirectoryGate` call `getToolInputPath`, which reads `input.path` for built-ins, `input.arguments.path` for MCP, and a registered `ToolAccessExtractor` (or the default `input.path` convention) for any other tool.
The extractor registry (`src/tool-access-extractor-registry.ts`) is created once in `index.ts` and shared: its lookup side is threaded into `ToolCallGatePipeline`, and its registrar side is exposed cross-extension via `PermissionsService.registerToolAccessExtractor`.
Per-tool path maps for extension tools (a custom extractor key per tool) are a deferred follow-up.

On the bash side, which argument tokens count as filesystem operands is settled by [ADR 0009](../decisions/0009-bash-path-projection-completeness-contract.md): candidacy comes from the filesystem (a bare token is a path candidate iff it names an existing entry), the decision comes from explicit rules or the external boundary, and the ADR names both what the projection guarantees and which gaps are accepted residuals rather than bugs.
A plain `$HOME` / `${HOME}` / `$PWD` / `${PWD}` reference is resolved at token collection, upstream of classification, so an expanded token is gated exactly as its literal spelling; the resolvable set is closed at those two names by the same ADR.

## Session approvals: the cache-miss model

Session rules are stored as `Ruleset` and are generalized to all surfaces.

`evaluate()` is a **lookup** against cached decisions.
When no rule matches (or the matching rule says "ask"), the system has a cache miss - it needs the human oracle to produce a decision.

The human's response is simultaneously:

1. **The answer** for this request (allow or deny).
2. **A rule** that can be cached for future lookups.

The dialog determines **persistence** - where the rule lives:

```text
  evaluate(surface, value, composedRules)
       │
       ├── match.action = "allow" → proceed (cache hit)
       ├── match.action = "deny"  → block (cache hit)
       │
       └── match.action = "ask"   → cache miss, query oracle
                │
                ▼
           Dialog: "[surface] wants to [value]"
                │
                ├── "Yes"              → allow this request (no persistence)
                ├── "Yes, for session" → allow + store in session layer
                │                        (future lookups hit without asking)
                ├── "No"               → deny this request (no persistence)
                └── (future: "Always") → allow + store in config layer (disk)
```

### Pattern suggestions

When prompting, each surface suggests a **pattern** for the "for session" option.
The pattern determines what class of future requests auto-approve:

| Surface                | Input value                 | Suggested session pattern   | Mechanism                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| bash                   | `git checkout main`         | `git checkout *`            | Arity table              |
| bash                   | `npm run dev`               | `npm run dev`               | Arity table              |
| tool (read/write/etc.) | tool surface itself         | `*` (all uses of that tool) | Tool-level               |
| mcp                    | `exa:search`                | `exa:*`                     | Server-level wildcard    |
| skill                  | `librarian`                 | `librarian`                 | Exact name               |
| external_directory     | `/other/project/src/foo.ts` | `/other/project/*`          | Directory prefix as glob |

The suggestion is shown in the dialog text so the user sees what they're approving:

```text
  ● Allow once
  ● Allow "git checkout *" for this session
  ● Deny
```

### Implementation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Gate as Elicitor (ask-path)
    participant Eval as evaluate()
    participant Session as Session Rules (Ruleset)

    Gate->>Eval: evaluate("bash", "git status", composedRules)
    Eval-->>Gate: { action: "ask" } (cache miss)
    Gate->>User: "Allow 'git status'? [Once / Session: 'git status*' / Deny]"
    User-->>Gate: "Session"
    Gate->>Session: append { surface: "bash", pattern: "git status*", action: "allow" }

    Note over Gate,Session: Next similar call - cache hit
    Gate->>Eval: evaluate("bash", "git status --short", composedRules incl. session)
    Eval-->>Gate: { action: "allow" } (matched session rule)
    Note over Gate: No prompt needed
```

## Prompt presentation

What a prompt must show, what a renderer may elide, and what bounds its size are settled by [ADR 0011](../decisions/0011-prompt-presentation-contract.md).
The contract in one line: **the payload is complete, and elision is a property of a render, never of the payload**.

A gate emits structured facts rather than a sentence.
The payload's `request` group — requester and forwarded-ness, tool name and invoked tool name, gate surface and matched rule, the decision-relevant value, and for bash the unit that will actually run — is never elided by any renderer.
`evidence` is complete on the payload and elided to fit each renderer's budget, with the elision marked but uncounted; an operator must still be able to reach the complete information while the decision is pending.
The dialog is bounded by a row budget plus a per-field width cap, the review log by its own configured limits, and the `permissions:ui_prompt` broadcast receives the `request` facts only — the narrowest renderer, because the bus is the one channel an extension observes without the operator having named it.
Denial text is a fifth render of the same facts under one extra rule: it identifies the call rather than reproducing it, since the agent already holds its own tool input.

The payload exists, and the human-facing renderers are bounded.
Every gate emits a `PromptPayload` (`src/presentation/`), and `PromptPermissionDetails` requires one, so the six former assembly sites are gone.
`renderPromptDialog` renders it for the inline dialog and the `select`/`input` fallback under `promptMaxRows` plus `promptFieldMaxWidth`, and `Ctrl+O` expands the dialog to the complete request.
The cap applies to the `request` facts too: never elided means never *omitted* — a long one is shortened, marked, and reachable in full rather than dropped.
Without that reading a bounded render is unreachable, since the decision-relevant value is itself the pathological field in the reported case ([#710]).
A fact an adjacent line already states is not repeated — a bash ask's gate surface is its tool name, and a path ask's is the word its value line is labelled with — so the render spends a line only where it adds something.
That is a redundancy rule, not an elision: the fact is still on screen, which is what §3 requires.

The wire, the broadcast, and the review log still read the flat `message` that `renderLegacyMessage` derives from the payload, so `toolInputPreviewMaxLength` and `toolTextSummaryMaxLength` still bound the non-bash previews the payload carries as evidence.
ADR 0011 records what each dependent item becomes under the contract.

## Two-phase checking

### Phase 1: Tool filtering (`before_agent_start`)

`shouldExposeTool` (`src/handlers/before-agent-start.ts`) calls `evaluate(toolName, "*", rules)` and exposes the tool unless the surface-level result is `deny` — "is this tool denied regardless of specific input?"

### Phase 2: Invocation gating (`tool_call`)

The gate pipeline (`src/handlers/gates/`) normalizes the input to `(surface, value)`, evaluates it against the composed ruleset, and acts on the result: `allow` proceeds, `deny` blocks, and `ask` elicits from the session's `Authorizer` — a persisted "session" decision appends a `Rule` to `sessionRules` so the next similar call is a cache hit.

Same `evaluate()`, same ruleset.
The only surface-specific logic is input normalization (what `surface` and `value` to look up) and pattern suggestion (what glob to offer for "session" approval).

`checkPermission()` uses a single evaluate path: `normalizeInput()` → `evaluateFirst()` → `deriveSource()` → single result object.

## Subagent detection and permission forwarding

When `ask`-state permissions arise in a headless subagent child process, the extension forwards the dialog to the parent session rather than silently denying.
This requires two detections:

1. **Is the current process a subagent?**
   - `isSubagentExecutionContext()` in `src/authority/subagent-context.ts`.
2. **What is the parent session ID?**
   - `resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId()` in `src/authority/permission-forwarding.ts`.

### Known extension env var inventory

| Extension                                                                           | Child-process env vars                                                                    | Parent-session env var              |

| [HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents](https://github.com/HazAT/pi-interactive-subagents) | `PI_SUBAGENT_NAME`, `PI_SUBAGENT_ID`, `PI_SUBAGENT_SESSION`, `PI_SUBAGENT_ACTIVITY_FILE`  | none set (see #98)                  |

### Detection (`isSubagentExecutionContext`)

`isSubagentExecutionContext()` checks three sources in priority order:

1. **Explicit registry** - `@gotgenes/pi-subagents` emits `subagents:child:session-created` before `bindExtensions()`; the permission system's subscriber writes the entry into `SubagentSessionRegistry` synchronously.
   The registry (keyed by **child session id**) is checked first.
   Each concurrent sibling child of the same parent receives a unique session id from `sessionManager.newSession()`, so siblings occupy distinct keys - one sibling's `disposed` event cannot evict another's entry (fixes #298).
   The registry is a process-global singleton (via `getSubagentSessionRegistry()`, backed by `globalThis` + `Symbol.for()`) because each session's `ResourceLoader` creates its own `pi.events` bus: the parent's instance registers the child over the parent bus, while the child's separate jiti instance reads the same global store to detect itself and resolve its forwarding target.
2. **Env vars** (`SUBAGENT_ENV_HINT_KEYS`) - returns `true` when any key is set to a non-empty, non-whitespace value.
   Used by process-based subagent extensions.
3. **Filesystem path** - session-directory path-based fallback (child session dir is nested under `subagentSessionsDir`).

### Parent-session resolution (`resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId`)

`resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId()` checks two sources in priority order:

1. **Explicit registry** - if the caller provides a `sessionId` and `registry`, the registry entry's `parentSessionId` is returned when present.
   Used by in-process subagent extensions.
2. **Env vars** (`SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION_ENV_CANDIDATES`) - iterates candidates and returns the first non-empty, non-`"unknown"` value.
   Used by process-based subagent extensions.

Neither nicobailon nor HazAT sets a parent-session env var today, so forwarding still fails for those extensions with an explicit log message pointing to #98.
Adding a new env var candidate when an extension adopts the convention is a one-line change to the array.

### In-process case (resolved)

In-process subagent extensions (e.g. `@gotgenes/pi-subagents`) call `createAgentSession()` directly - no child process is spawned and no env vars are ever set.
`@gotgenes/pi-subagents` publishes `subagents:child:session-created` (before `bindExtensions()`) and `subagents:child:disposed` (in the run's `finally`); `src/authority/subagent-lifecycle-events.ts` subscribes and writes/removes the entry in `SubagentSessionRegistry` synchronously.
The registry is process-global (see `getSubagentSessionRegistry()` in `src/authority/subagent-registry.ts`) so the child's separate jiti instance reads the same store as the parent.
See `src/authority/subagent-registry.ts` and [Subagent Integration](../subagent-integration.md) for details.

### External convention guide

A [permission frontmatter convention guide](../guides/permission-frontmatter-for-subagent-extensions.md) documents how upstream subagent extensions can adopt the `permission:` frontmatter key as a shared convention.
This is a documentation-only proposal - no code dependency is required.
The guide covers the two-layer model, flat format reference, composition examples, and the optional event bus runtime integration.

## Cross-extension service accessor

The primary cross-extension API is a `Symbol.for()`-backed service object on `globalThis`.

Pi's extension loader creates a fresh jiti instance per extension with `moduleCache: false`, isolating module-scoped state.
`Symbol.for()` and `globalThis` are process-global by spec, so they survive this isolation.

The extension publishes a `PermissionsService` object via `publishPermissionsService()` at `session_start`, gated so an in-process subagent child does not clobber the parent's service (#302).
Other extensions retrieve it with `getPermissionsService()` from `import("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system")`.
The `package.json` `exports` field's `default` condition points to `src/service.ts`, which contains the interface, the accessor functions, and the `Symbol.for()` key - no extension machinery.
The `types` condition instead resolves to a bundled `dist/public.d.ts` (built by `rollup-plugin-dts` from `rollup.dts.config.mjs`, published via `prepack`) so a downstream consumer's `tsc` never follows the raw `#src/*` module graph - only the `default` condition (the jiti runtime) reads `src/` directly (#592).

The `PermissionsService` interface exposes five methods:

- `checkPermission(surface, value?, agentName?)` - full policy query.
- `getToolPermission(toolName, agentName?)` - tool-level permission state (`allow`/`deny`/`ask`) for pre-filtering.
- `registerToolInputFormatter(toolName, formatter)` - register a custom ask-prompt preview for a tool name; returns a disposer (#283).
- `registerToolAccessExtractor(toolName, extractor)` - declare the filesystem path a non-conventional tool accesses, so the cross-cutting `path`/`external_directory` gates see it; returns a disposer (#352).
- `registerAuthorizer(name, authorize)` - register a named live-authority chain link (`allow | deny | defer`, ADR 0007 §4); decides nothing until the operator names it in `authorizerChain` config, and every verdict is capped by the bounded-delegation checkpoint; returns a disposer.

`permissions:decision` and `permissions:ui_prompt` broadcasts remain on the event bus - fire-and-forget observation is the right abstraction for those channels ([#531] removed the event-bus RPC channel; the service accessor is now the sole cross-extension policy/prompt surface).

## The authority model

This section records the organizing concept the package is built around — the spine the elicitation, forwarding, and yolo machinery collapse into — plus the still-open directions that extend it.
It is current state, not a target: the `Authorizer` interface, its three implementations, once-per-activation selection, `canConfirm()`'s dissolution, serving-as-resolution, human-selectable grant-scope, and the `authority/` directory migration all shipped in Phase 9 (see [history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md](history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md) for why the spine is the correct model of the `@gotgenes/pi-subagents` integration — the anonymous cross-session-authority recursion behind the [#296]/[#298]/[#302] bug history — and not merely an internal tidy).
Of the ["beyond the target"](#beyond-the-target-a-non-deterministic-access-intent-classifier) extension points below, the model-triage `Authorizer` chain is now implemented (Phase 12; [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md)), and its named-link registration subsumes the pluggable escalation seam; the deny-first slice is dogfooded by `packages/pi-permission-model-judge`, and the allow-capable opaque-bash adjudicator ([#620]) remains the sole open Track B slice.
A non-deterministic access-intent classifier remains aspirational.

### The spine

Every action resolves against an **authority** — an entity empowered to permit or forbid it.
The only questions are *which* authority and how we reach it.

This sharpens principle 8.
That principle calls the human "the oracle," borrowing the computer-science term for a black box consulted for an answer the system cannot compute.
But a permission decision is not epistemic (who *knows* the answer); it is deontic (who has the *right* to decide).
If a bystander happened to know what the user wanted, their saying "allow" would authorize nothing.
What makes a decision binding is authority, not knowledge — so the organizing concept is authority, and the entity that holds it is an **`Authorizer`**.
The human is merely the `Authorizer` at the interactive root; another agent can hold the role equally well.

### Authority lives in three places

1. **Recorded authority** — the ruleset.
   Config (durable, on disk), session rules (this session), and synthesized defaults/baseline are all prior rulings.
   `evaluate()` *is* "consult recorded authority": an `allow` or `deny` means recorded authority is sufficient, and the decision is final.
2. **Live authority** — reached only on `ask`, when recorded authority is silent.
   An entity empowered to rule *now*, reached through one of three channels (below).
3. **Absent authority** — nothing recorded, nothing reachable.
   Least privilege applies: no authority means the action is unauthorized, so it is denied.

The three are one thing at different lifetimes.
A live ruling, once persisted, *becomes* recorded authority — principle 8's "their decision is a rule."
The "for this session" dialog option writes a session rule; a future "always" writes config.

### The `Authorizer` role

On `ask`, the gate escalates to **one `Authorizer`, selected once per session from context**, and is told the decision.

1. **`LocalUserAuthorizer`** — the session has UI; prompt the human here.
2. **`ParentAuthorizer`** — the session is a subagent; escalate up the tree to the parent's authority.
3. **`DenyingAuthorizer`** — no authority is reachable; deny (least privilege).

There is no "can anyone answer" pre-check.
`canConfirm()` — today a boolean smeared across the gateway, prompter, and forwarder — dissolves: every `Authorizer` answers, the `DenyingAuthorizer` by denying.
The three context predicates (`hasUI`, `isSubagent`, yolo) are evaluated once, at selection, instead of repeatedly down the prompt path.

```text
evaluate(action, recorded authority)
  ├─ allow / deny ------------------> decided (recorded authority sufficient)
  └─ ask (recorded authority silent)
        └─ escalate to the session's Authorizer
              ├─ LocalUserAuthorizer -> prompt the human here
              ├─ ParentAuthorizer    -> forward up the tree, await the parent's ruling
              └─ DenyingAuthorizer    -> deny (no authority reachable)
                    |
              (a persisted ruling becomes recorded authority)
```

### The recursion

Authority is delegated **down** the session tree: the human drives the root, which spawns subagents that hold no inherent authority to approve a novel action.
So an `ask` a subagent cannot answer **escalates up** to where authority resides.
Permission-system instances form a tree mirroring the session tree, and `ParentAuthorizer` is the edge that routes a child's escalation toward the human at the root.
This is the same recursion pi-subagents describes (a subagent is a child Pi), viewed from the permission system's side: the package is itself one of the hooks on that child, and it recurses by forwarding.

### Reconstruction fidelity at the serving node

The courier hop carries facts, not judgment — but what the serving node reconstructs from a forwarded request differs by audience, and the two directions are the same rule applied to different trust boundaries.

An **in-process seam** — the `Authorizer` chain, reached through `PromptPermissionDetails` — receives the full child-fixed fact set.
A chain link is operator-opted-in via `authorizerChain` and must decide from evidence, not from parsed display text or a parent-side re-derivation of the child's path ([ADR 0008](../decisions/0008-cross-session-access-intent.md) forbids the latter outright).
The bounded-delegation checkpoint reads the same facts, so a forwarded ask is capped on the gate surface exactly as a local one is ([ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md) §5).

A **cross-extension broadcast** — `permissions:ui_prompt` / `permissions:decision` on `pi.events` — receives the minimum needed to stay correlatable, because any loaded extension can observe it.

Maximum fidelity to the decider; minimum disclosure to the observer.
Requester identity (`requesterCwd`, `principal`) crosses to neither: it is the serving node's own resolution input (ADR 0008 §3) and stays on the wire object, with the ask details carrying only the `forwarding` provenance.

### yolo is recorded authority

yolo is not a channel and not a live concern — it is a standing authorization, and it belongs in the ruleset, not in the prompt path.
It is a composition-stage rewrite: when enabled, every `ask` action in the composed ruleset is rewritten to `allow`, tagged `origin: "yolo"` so the review log still distinguishes a yolo grant from a policy allow.

```typescript
const effective = yolo
  ? composed.map((r) => (r.action === "ask" ? { ...r, action: "allow", origin: "yolo" } : r))
  : composed;
```

This is faithful to current behavior exactly: explicit `deny` rules are not `ask`, so they pass through untouched — yolo suppresses prompts but **preserves hard denies**.
It honors principle 5 (defaults are rules; no side-channel fallbacks): `evaluate()` runs pure over the rewritten ruleset, and the prompt path loses all yolo knowledge (`shouldAutoApprovePermissionState` and `canResolveAskPermissionRequest`'s yolo arm dissolve).

The ruleset is the whole story for asks the ruleset produces.
An `ask` synthesized *after* resolution is not one: the bash wrapper floor (#481, #490) and the fail-closed `<unparseable-bash-command>` sentinel (#452) are properties of a parsed command unit, not of a pattern, so there is no rule for the rewrite to touch and they reached the prompter under yolo (#712).
The reconciliation has exactly one home — `resolveYoloGrant` at `GateRunner`'s auto-approve fast path, the single choke point every gate passes through before escalating — so the contract "an `ask` never reaches `PermissionPrompter` under yolo" holds structurally for whatever floor is added next.
It is the same deny-preserving shape as the rewrite: a `deny` is not an `ask`, so it matches neither arm.
A future "disable everything" mode — overriding denies too — would be a *different*, deliberately named operation: appending a final `{ surface: "*", pattern: "*", action: "allow" }` rule (last-match-wins).
It is not built, and it would be requested by name, never conflated with yolo.

### Fail-closed on an invalid non-global scope

The mirror image of the yolo rewrite.
When a non-global config scope (project, agent, or project-agent) is present but fails to load or validate, the loader marks it invalid (`ScopeConfig.invalid`) instead of silently substituting an empty scope.
At composition the manager floors every `allow` in the composed ruleset to `ask`, tagged `origin: "fail-closed"`, so a permissive rule inherited from a lower-precedence scope cannot remain effective behind a higher scope that was meant to tighten it (#646).

```typescript
const effective =
  failClosedScopes.length > 0
    ? composed.map((r) => (r.action === "allow" ? { ...r, action: "ask", origin: "fail-closed" } : r))
    : composed;
```

Like yolo it is deny-preserving (only `allow` is touched) and applied at composition, so the display surfaces (`getComposedConfigRules`, `getToolPermission`) reflect the clamp too.
Global is excluded — it is the lowest precedence, so nothing more permissive is inherited when it fails.
The two overlays stack in order: fail-closed floors `allow`→`ask` first, then yolo (if enabled) rewrites `ask`→`allow`, so an explicit yolo opt-in still wins.

### Discriminating delegation: a model `Authorizer`

Nothing constrains an `Authorizer` to be deterministic.
`LocalUserAuthorizer` is already a non-deterministic oracle — the human — and the determinism principle governs *recorded* authority (`evaluate()`), never the live-authority layer.
A model (e.g. Claude Haiku) can hold an `Authorizer` role on the same terms: it is live authority, so it never touches `evaluate()` or the deterministic core.

The design is settled in [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md); the essentials follow.

**The live-authority layer is a Chain of Responsibility.**
Each link returns `allow | deny | defer`; on `defer` the next link decides.
The chain ends at a **terminal that cannot defer** — today the human (`LocalUserAuthorizer`), the headless `DenyingAuthorizer`, or `ParentAuthorizer` (terminal for its node, forwarding up to the parent node's chain — the [recursion](#the-recursion) above).
The invariant is type-level: a terminal returns only `allow | deny`, so a deferring link cannot occupy the terminal slot.
`selectAuthorizer` becomes the terminal-selection step of `composeAuthorizerChain` — registered non-terminal links, then the context-selected terminal.

**One chain per node.**
An ask is adjudicated by exactly one node's chain: the node whose terminal decides it (ADR 0007 §7).
A subagent node's terminal relays the ask to a serving node, which escalates it through *its* chain over the same child-fixed facts — so a relaying node resolves no links, and records `authorizer_chain_delegated` rather than reporting each configured name as a fail-safe skip.
An adjudicating node records `authorizer_chain_resolved` with the names it consulted, since a deferring link decides nothing and otherwise leaves no evidence it ran.

```text
ask -> [ model-judge link ] --defer--> … --defer--> [ terminal: human | Parent | Denying ]
              ├─ deny (with teaching reason)   -> denied
              ├─ allow (slice 2, if not excluded) -> permitted
              └─ defer                          -> next link
```

**The model judge is a non-terminal link**, not a decorator or a fourth channel.
It reviews an `ask`, decides the ones it is confident about, and defers the rest to its successor — a middle rung between prompt-everything and allow-everything.
Denies are decided by recorded authority and structurally never reach an `Authorizer`, so a model link cannot grant a hard deny; the safeguard for a sensitive resource stays an explicit `deny` rule, which survives the model just as it survives the yolo rewrite.

The verdict range is `allow | deny | defer` — a superset of the earlier allow-or-escalate framing — because the first use case is **deny-first**.
A light model reviews `external_directory` asks, denies an errant "typo" path with a teaching `reason` (wrong path; correct location) so the invoking model self-corrects, and defers everything else.
A second use case adjudicates **opaque bash**: the model decomposes a `bash -c "…"` / `eval` command and queries the deterministic engine per sub-command through an injected, narrow `PermissionQuery` (never a reach-through to `PermissionsService`), allowing only what the engine already grants for the pieces it identifies.
The two are one link on a **capability gradient**: the deny/defer reviewer is strictly more restrictive and ships first; the allow-capable adjudicator loosens privilege and is gated behind the full envelope (hard exclusions, audit `origin: "authorizer:model"`, non-persistence, off by default), because its safety property holds only if the model's decomposition is faithful.

Registration mirrors `registerToolAccessExtractor`: a downstream extension offers a **named** capability (`registerAuthorizer("model-judge", …)`) on `permissions:ready`, and this package makes no LLM call itself.
Three invariants govern the seam: config order (not registration order) fixes the security-relevant chain order; a missing configured link is skipped fail-safe (more prompting, never less); and **registration alone grants no authority** — a link decides nothing until the operator names it in the `authorizerChain` config (opt-in).
Bounded delegation is operator config this package enforces at a checkpoint that downgrades an excluded-surface `allow` to `defer`, with `external_directory` and secret-shaped `path` always excluded; the model's provider/prompt/threshold live in the downstream extension's own config.

This is the principled successor to the per-command argument-position work deferred from [#509].
The bash path projection surfaces a bare token that names a real file ([#645]) and deliberately accepts a fail-safe false positive (`grep id_rsa secrets.txt` prompts when an `id_rsa` file happens to exist); that false positive lives on the *ask-producing* side of `evaluate()`, and the model link dismisses it on the *ask-consuming* side without hard-coding per-command file-argument tables.
This split is the layering principle of [ADR 0009](../decisions/0009-bash-path-projection-completeness-contract.md): the deterministic layer biases toward surfacing because over-suppression is unrecoverable, and the judge absorbs the surplus.
The two compose cleanly because a promoted token emits the same structured descriptor a prefixed path does, so a link needs no promotion-specific knowledge.

**Dogfooded:** a first-party monorepo package (`packages/pi-permission-model-judge`) implements the deny-first typo-path reviewer against the real seam, so `registerAuthorizer` is born consumed (the [#267] vacant-surface guard).

### Resolved direction

These were the open decisions; they are now settled and shipped (full rationale in [history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md](history/phase-9-authorizer-spine.md)).

1. **Serving is resolution.**
   A serving node runs `evaluate()` against its recorded authority then escalates to its own `Authorizer` on `ask`, carrying the forwarded ask's provenance as data so the `permissions:ui_prompt` broadcast stays non-degraded.
2. **Multi-level escalation: admitted, not shipped.**
   A middle node's chain terminates in a `ParentAuthorizer`, so re-escalation needs no special-casing; the tree is depth-2 today (pi-subagents' recursion guard), and a one-hop canary flags any future break.
3. **Full delegation of authority down the tree.**
   A subagent inherits its ancestors' `allow`/`deny` rules and yolo; because yolo is deny-preserving, the safeguard for a cheaper delegate is an explicit `deny` in its per-agent frontmatter, not an `ask`.
4. **Grant scope is human-selectable.**
   Approving a forwarded request "for this session" offers root / parent / requesting-subagent scope (requesting subagent pre-selected); "parent" and "root" coincide until trees deepen.

### Remaining design work

**Access-intent extraction** is the one genuinely open piece, and the foundation for the path surface of the decisions above.
The package's center of mass is not the decision engine (tiny, pure) but turning `(toolName, input)` into "what is being accessed" — bash decomposition, MCP target derivation, path extraction, external-directory detection.
This is a distinct domain (access intent) that gates should *emit* and a single `resolve(intent)` should answer, so adding a gate cannot widen the resolver surface.
The [#393] false-green (a stubbed-but-unrouted resolver method silently passing `allow`) was the probe pointing at it: the resolver surface was `resolve` + `resolvePathPolicy`, widening per gate, until Phase 6 Step 6 ([#478]) collapsed it to one `resolve(intent)`.
[#418] is a second probe, from the access-path side: both external-directory gates matched config patterns against the symlink-resolved path because a single `string` carries a path that is simultaneously a containment value (canonical, for the outside-CWD boundary) and a match value (lexical, as the user typed it), with no type distinction — so the canonical form leaked into matching and defeated a configured `/tmp/*` allow.
The same conflation lived in `BashProgram.externalPaths(): string[]`, which returned only the canonical form and so lost the typed value the matcher needed.
The fix's `getExternalDirectoryPolicyValues` helper (the union of lexical aliases and the canonical path) was the embryo of the access-path: `AccessPath` ([#476]) now holds both forms behind distinct `matchValues()` and boundary accessors, making the misuse a compile error; `BashProgram.externalPaths()` now returns `AccessPath[]` and one external-directory policy check can replace the two parallel gates that independently acquired this bug.
The tractable first slice was the access-path value object seeded by [#418]: it removed the path-representation conflation and the duplicate external-directory gate without waiting on principal identity or cross-session portability.
Principal identity and path portability across cwds — a subagent in a `pi-subagents-worktrees` worktree resolves paths against a different root than the parent — are now settled: [ADR 0008](../decisions/0008-cross-session-access-intent.md) (Phase 12) fixes a path-shaped ask's portable meaning at the child (the child's lexical ∪ canonical `matchValues()` plus canonical `boundaryValue()`), carries it onto the forwarded wire as `ForwardedAccessIntent`, and makes serving agent-scoped (`requesterAgentName` decision-participating).
A forwarded ask now resolves against the child-fixed alias set rather than a re-derivation through the parent's `PathNormalizer`/cwd.
With principal identity and path portability delivered, this domain has no further genuinely open piece; a non-path serving refinement (a per-surface `Authorizer` chain exclusion beyond `external_directory`/secret-shaped `path`) remains a candidate but is not scheduled.

### Beyond the target: a non-deterministic access-intent classifier

This is a **more distant** direction than the target above — noted as a candidate extension point, not planned work.

Access-intent extraction is deterministic by design: `(toolName, input)` becomes "what is being accessed" through bash decomposition, MCP target derivation, and path rules.
A second, independent place non-determinism could one day enter is a model that *classifies* access intent **before** `evaluate()` — deciding, for instance, that `id_rsa` in `git grep id_rsa` is a search pattern rather than a file, so no path candidate is emitted at all.

The classifier differs from the [`ModelTriageAuthorizer`](#discriminating-delegation-a-model-authorizer) in *where the model sits*.
The classifier feeds **recorded** authority — it shapes the intent `evaluate()` rules on — whereas the Authorizer holds **live** authority and answers the `ask`.
A wrong classifier call is a misread of what is being accessed; a wrong Authorizer call is a mis-granted decision.
Because the classifier changes the *input* to the deterministic core, it weakens the "same `(toolName, input)` yields the same ruling" property more subtly than the Authorizer does — the model output becomes part of the intent — so it warrants its own decision record and is deliberately out of scope for the current target.
The access-intent domain the gates emit into is the natural seam for such a pluggable classifier: deterministic today, model-assisted only if and when that trade is made by name.

### Beyond the target: a pluggable escalation seam

The **registration seam** this section anticipated is now designed: [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md) settles the `Authorizer` chain and its named-link registration (`registerAuthorizer`), with the model judge as its first consumer.
What remains a **more distant** direction — a candidate extension point, not planned work — is applying that same seam to *replace the terminal* (a delegation framework other than pi-subagents, a chat-approval bot, or a remote review surface *as* the authority) and refactoring the built-in subagent integration to register through it.

The [#261]/[#267] inversion made pi-subagents pure — it publishes its child lifecycle and knows nothing about consumers ([ADR-0002]) — but the purity is one-sided: this package is the integration owner.
It knows pi-subagents' event channel names (`subagent-lifecycle-events.ts`), hardcodes an env-hint inventory of known third-party subagent extensions (`SUBAGENT_ENV_HINT_KEYS`), and bakes in a session-directory heuristic.
Supporting a new delegation framework — or something that is not a subagent extension at all, such as a chat-approval bot or a remote review surface — means editing this package.

The subagent machinery decomposes into three roles a seam would name and separate:

- **Detection** — is this session a delegated context?
  This is an Authorizer-selection predicate; [#529]'s `SubagentDetection` gives it one owner.
- **Target resolution** — where does authority live for this session; which node serves the escalation (`resolvePermissionForwardingTargetSessionId` today).
- **Transport** — how an `ask` travels to that authority and the ruling returns (the file-based request/response polling today; [#530]'s escalation-up role, `ParentAuthorizer` since [#555]).

A registered provider is exactly a selection predicate plus a `ParentAuthorizer`-shaped transport: "when my predicate matches this session and recorded authority is silent, escalate through me."
The `Authorizer` spine is therefore the seam — this direction is the spine's registration story, not a mechanism beside it.

Two shapes, the second generalizing the first:

1. **A bridge extension** — a third package subscribes to pi-subagents' lifecycle and registers with this package's public seam, leaving both cores pure.
   A dedicated glue extension knowing both ends is the sanctioned complement of the rule against outbound bridges *from a core*.
2. **A dogfooded provider seam** — this package defines the registration API and implements its own built-in pi-subagents integration through it, the way `registerToolAccessExtractor` / `registerToolInputFormatter` already let extensions plug the gates; third parties register on equal terms and the zero-config default survives.

A history guard: this re-introduces an inbound registration surface of the kind [#267] retired.
It differs in kind — consumer-agnostic, documented for third parties, and consumed by the built-in provider itself, so it cannot go vacant the way the two-method `registerSubagentSession` RPC did.

Any design must honor the standing constraints: registration lands synchronously before `bindExtensions()`; cross-session visibility rides `globalThis` + `Symbol.for()` (the [#296] bus-split lesson); a provider is live authority only and never touches `evaluate()`; and a session no provider claims selects `DenyingAuthorizer` — least privilege, unchanged.
It sequences after the Phase 9 spine and warrants its own decision record.

### Naming

The concept and the code role take two grammatical forms of one root, each for what it correctly denotes:

- **`authority`** (mass noun) — the right to decide; used for the concept ("recorded authority," "where authority lives").
- **`Authorizer`** (count noun) — the entity that holds it; used for the interface and its implementations.

`Authorizer` is domain-idiomatic: AWS Lambda "authorizers" and OAuth's authorization server return allow/deny, so the term already denotes an entity that can refuse.

Constraint: stays string-based — must not import `AccessPath` (the ADR 0002 string boundary, lint-guarded by `no-restricted-imports`)
├── permission-gate.ts        Pure deny/ask/allow gate (injected IO)
├── permission-resolver.ts    `ScopedPermissionResolver` interface - the single `{ resolve(intent) }` role the gate factories / runner / pipeline depend on; `PermissionResolver` concrete class holds `ScopedPermissionManager` + `SessionRules`, owns `resolve(intent)` (unwraps an `access-path` `AccessIntent` via `matchValues()` before calling `manager.check`; the concrete class also accepts a pre-fixed `path-values` intent as a passthrough — the forwarded-serving wire's producer, #597 — while the gate-facing interface stays narrow to `AccessIntent`), raw `checkPermission` (`implements SkillPermissionChecker`, no session rules), `getToolPermission`, and `getConfigIssues`

├── decision-audit.ts         `DecisionRecorder` / `DecisionSummaryWriter` / `AuditLogger` interfaces + `DecisionAudit` class - per-session decision counters; `writeSummary` emits a `permission.session_summary` debug line on shutdown and warns on a `toolCalls != allowed + blocked + errors` invariant violation
├── session-approval-recorder.ts `SessionApprovalRecorder` interface - records a granted session-scoped approval into the session ruleset; implemented by `SessionRules`
│
├── permission-session.ts     `PermissionSession` class - state/lifecycle owner: owns context lifecycle, session-rule lifecycle (`reset`/`shutdown`/`reload`), skill entries, agent-name resolution, the config gateway, the Tell-Don't-Ask gate inputs, and `notify(message)` (UI warn over the owned context, no-op before activation); `implements ToolCallGateInputs`. The resolve role lives in `PermissionResolver`, the recorder role in `SessionRules`; handlers depend on the concrete class + `PermissionResolver`
├── path-normalizer.ts        `PathNormalizer` class - the path-interpretation collaborator constructed once at the session edge with the injected `PathFlavor` (exposed as `readonly flavor`) and session `cwd` baked in; hands raw tokens, returns prepared values: `forPath`/`forLiteral` (build `AccessPath`s), `isAbsolute`/`resolveBase`/`joinBase` (flavor-aware `cd`-fold routing), `isWithinDirectory`/`isOutsideWorkingDirectory` (containment), `comparableValue` (lexical comparison for skill-prompt matching), `isInfrastructureRead`, and `forBashToken`/`interpretBashCdTarget`/`isBoundaryOutsideWorkingDirectory` (Git Bash/MSYS bash-token interpretation — safe devices preserved, `/c/…` drive mounts translated, other POSIX absolutes literal-only). Also owns `entryExists` (lstat), the existence probe deciding whether a bare bash token names a real filesystem entry, kept here so path interpretation has a single filesystem edge alongside canonicalization (ADR 0009). A facade over the `path/` and `access-intent/path-normalization` primitives; holds no platform discriminator — every platform question delegates to `flavor`, so no consumer reads `process.platform` or threads `cwd`
├── access-intent/           Access-intent domain: turns `(toolName, input)` into what is being accessed (bash decomposition, MCP targets, path extraction, the `AccessPath` value object and `AccessIntent` union)
│   ├── path-normalization.ts `AccessPath`'s representation backing: `normalizePathForComparison` (lexical absolute, via `flavor.comparable`), `canonicalNormalizePathForComparison` (symlink-resolved + win32-lowercased via `flavor.fold`), `normalizePathPolicyLiteral` (literal cleanup), `getPathPolicyValues` (lexical ∪ relative match set) + `PathPolicyValueOptions`; pure derivation over an injected `PathFlavor`
│   ├── access-intent.ts     `AccessIntent` discriminated union each gate emits: `tool` (raw input the manager normalizes) and `access-path` (an `AccessPath` for every path gate — `path`, `external_directory`, and the per-tool path-bearing surfaces `read`/`write`/`edit`/`grep`/`find`/`ls`). Constraint: `ResolvedAccessIntent` (`tool | path-values`) is what the manager consumes after the resolver unwraps `access-path` via `matchValues()` — `path-values` is still not gate-emitted, keeping the manager string-based (the ADR 0002 boundary), but since #597 it has a second legitimate producer: the forwarded-serving wire builds a `path-values` intent directly from a `ForwardedAccessIntent`'s child-fixed `matchValues`, via `buildResolvedIntentFromMatchValues` (`input-normalizer.ts`)
│   ├── access-path.ts       `AccessPath` value object: `matchValues(): string[]` (lexical alias union ∪ canonical, the match set), `boundaryValue(): string` (symlink-resolved + win32-lowercased), `value(): string` (lexical absolute display form), `resolvedAlias(): string | undefined` (the canonical form only when distinct, for disclosing a symlink target in a prompt/denial); `forPath(pathValue, { cwd, resolveBase?, flavor })` serves every path surface, `forLiteral(literal)` builds a literal-only path with no canonical for the unknown-base bash case, and `forDevice(devicePath)` preserves an MSYS device path verbatim. Type-distinct accessors make the lexical/canonical conflation a compile error
│   ├── tool-kind.ts        `ToolKind` string-union + `classifyToolKind(toolName)` — the single dispatch point deciding what an invocation accesses (bash command / MCP target / skill / path-bearing tool / extension) once at the normalize boundary; imports only `PATH_BEARING_TOOLS` (AccessPath-free, so `permission-manager.ts` may consume it without breaching the ADR 0002 string boundary).

│       ├── nested-execution.ts Shared nested-execution vocabulary for both bash surfaces: `NESTED_EXECUTION_CONTEXTS` (substitution node type → `BashCommandContext`), `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES` (node types that are not commands or argument values but whose subtree can host a command that really runs — redirects, heredoc/herestring bodies), and `forEachNestedExecution(node, visit)`, which searches strictly within a subtree and does not descend past a context it finds. Constraint: the command surface and the path surface must share one definition of a nested execution, or a command gated on one surface escapes the other (#741)
│       ├── shell-variable-expansion.ts Pure plain-reference resolver: `resolvePlainVariableExpansion(node): string | null` — `$HOME`/`${HOME}` → `os.homedir()`, `$PWD`/`${PWD}` → `.` (the base-relative marker, so the resolver's existing `resolveBase` applies it after `cd` folding). Plainness is structural (exactly one `variable_name` child, otherwise only delimiters), so an operator form (`${HOME:-/tmp}`, `${#HOME}`) is rejected without enumerating bash's expansion operators. Constraint: the resolvable set is closed at `HOME`/`PWD` — widening it is an ADR 0009 amendment, and the expansion vocabulary lives only here, never in the classifiers
│       ├── token-collection.ts Bash argument/flag tokenizer: `collectPathCandidateTokens`, `collectCommandTokens`, `collectRedirectTokens`, `extractCommandName` (exported); private `PATTERN_FIRST_COMMANDS` table and pattern/generic collectors, plus `collectEmbeddedOptionValues` — emits the inline value of an `--opt=value` argument as its own token, read from the argument nodes (a pattern-first collector classifies a flag and never emits it), so an option-embedded path is classified by the ordinary shape rules without per-command option tables (#645). Also projects the operands of a command hosted in a redirect destination or an interpolating heredoc body; the `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES` dispatch sits above the `SKIP_SUBTREE_TYPES` check because `heredoc_body` is in both sets and the host reading must win — its prose stays out of the path surface while its substitution's operands enter it (#741)
│       ├── command-enumeration.ts Bash command enumerator: `collectCommands` (exported) + the descend/skip tables and the node→`CommandWord` adapter; owns the `BashCommand` interface including the `wrapperKind` discriminant and the display-only `executedUnit`; strips leading `variable_assignment` prefixes from command units. Constraint: `COMMAND_ENUM_SKIP` holds only genuinely inert types (`comment`, `heredoc_end`) — a node that is not a command but can host one belongs in `EXECUTION_HOST_TYPES`, and conflating the two questions is the bypass #741 fixed
│       ├── wrapper-analysis.ts Pure word-based wrapper interpretation: `classifyWrapperWords` (the `WrapperKind` discriminant — `"opaque-payload"` for `bash -c`/`eval`, `"indirection"` for sudo/env/xargs/find -exec/…) and `executedUnitOf` (the command a wrapper actually runs), over the shared wrapper vocabulary. Constraint: both answers read one vocabulary — the shape that floors a unit to `ask` and the shape that names its inner command cannot drift. `executedUnitOf` is display-only and fails to `null` rather than to a guess, so it never weakens a gate
│       ├── bash-path-resolver.ts  `BashPathResolver` class (constructed with a `PathNormalizer` and an optional `workdir`): `resolve(rootNode): ResolvedBashPaths` walks the AST once, tagging each path-candidate token with the `EffectiveBase` in force at its position, and returns `{ externalPaths: AccessPath[], ruleCandidates: BashPathRuleCandidate[] }`; routes every path through the injected `PathNormalizer`. Both projections fall back to the shared `probeBareToken` for a token the shape gates reject, admitting it only when `normalizer.entryExists` confirms it names a real entry and the effective base is known; `projectRuleCandidates` passes `this.normalizer.flavor` so a win32 backslash-relative token is recognized like its `/` form; `projectExternalPaths` decides outside-cwd from the `AccessPath`'s canonical boundary via `collectIfExternal`, treating a literal-only bash token as unconditionally external. Constraint: consults no ruleset — candidacy is a filesystem question and the decision belongs to the gates (ADR 0009). The subtlest region in the package

Constraint: policy-free — no classifier consults the ruleset (ADR 0009)
│       ├── sync-commands.ts    `parseBashCommandsSync(command): BashCommand[] | null` — warm-parser-backed synchronous command enumeration; returns `null` in the pre-warm window so the advisory bash path falls back to whole-string matching
│       └── program.ts         Born-ready `BashProgram` value object: `parse(command, normalizer, options?)` eagerly resolves all three slices at construction; parameter-free getters `commands()`, `externalPaths(): AccessPath[]`, `pathRuleCandidates()`. `commands()` splits the chain AND descends into command/process substitutions and subshells — wherever they appear, including a redirect destination and an interpolating heredoc body (#741) — tagging each nested command with its execution `context`, stripping any leading `variable_assignment` prefix, and flagging wrapper units with a `wrapperKind` so their decision floors to `ask`

## Improvement roadmap — Phase 13: The prompt-presentation seam

### Findings (planned 2026-08-15)

The declared candidate is [ADR 0011](../decisions/0011-prompt-presentation-contract.md) (the prompt-presentation contract), whose Staging section assigns its decomposition to this planning pass.
The cause is a structural fusion of presentation with decision-making, recorded in the [Prompt presentation](#prompt-presentation) section above: six sites assemble a flat prompt `message` string (`formatAskPrompt`'s three branches, the skill prompts, the external-directory prompts, `formatPathAskPrompt`, the per-tool previews, and the parent-side forwarded prefix) that travels unchanged to every consumer — the inline dialog, the `select`/`input` fallback, the review log, the `permissions:ui_prompt` broadcast, and the forwarded wire.
Because the payload is a pre-rendered sentence, elision is a payload property rather than a render property: the bash branch has no cap, nothing bounds height ([#710]), a forwarded ask is assembled twice under two configs, and every denial path echoes unbounded input into the agent's context.
The phase implements the contract's staged first step — the complete payload and the renderer seam — so [#710] is fixed by construction and [#713] becomes a conformance requirement of the payload's invariant core rather than a separate enhancement.

Corroboration (fallow + sweeps, 2026-08-15): health 88 (A; deductions are unit size and coupling), dead code 0, duplication 0.2% (the documented intentional `literalTextOf`/`resolveNodeText` pair plus one new 16-line internal clone in `token-collection.ts`).
The repeated-discriminator sweep found no new family — survivors are validation-edge `typeof` guards, per-node AST dispatch, and boundary translation, idiomatic per the taxonomy.
The `value-guards.ts` refactoring target remains rejected (healthy high-fan-in leaf).
The craftsmanship scout re-refuted all three fallow giant-test flags (nested `describe` trees of small behavior-named tests, unchanged since Phase 12) and found one concentrated cluster: six duplicated local test factories (`PermissionCheckResult` builders and `ToolPreviewFormatter` options literals) across `denial-messages.test.ts`, `permission-prompts.test.ts`, and `tool-preview-formatter.test.ts` — exactly the presentation test files the spine rewrites, so the extraction rides Step 1 as a tidy-first prep commit.
Directory check: the spine rewrites the ~8 cohesive presentation modules at the flat `src/` root, so per the recorded reorg convention this phase seeds `src/presentation/` and the touched modules reach their final home the first time.

Open-issue sweep dispositions (user-decided):

- [#710] — adopted as Step 2 (the bounded local renderers are its fix by construction); closed with it.
- PR [#738] (highlight the flagged element in TUI prompts) — swept in during Step 1 planning, having been filed the day before this phase was scoped.
  Highlighting is a **render** concern under ADR 0011, so its intent is adopted in Step 2's dialog renderer with authorship credited, and the PR closes as superseded rather than being rebased — the same disposition [#716] received.
  Both were adopted and credited when Step 2 landed.
- [#713] — its inner-command fact enters the payload in Step 1 and becomes visible in every render in Step 2 (the `runs` line); it closed with Step 2.
- [#721] / [#735] — adopted as Step 5: out-of-process forwarding liveness; [#735]'s scenario 1 (dead parent) is resolved by it, while scenario 2 (a parent whose turn is occupied) stays with the [#722] diagnosis, which remains open and out of scope.
- [#726] — adopted as Step 6 (decision provenance).
- [#732] — adopted as Step 7 (model-judge `agentDir` fix).
- [#655] — adopted as Step 8 (`deriveApprovalPattern` flavor injection).
- [#620] — deferred with recorded rationale: one phase old, non-gating, the `registerAuthorizer` seam it consumes exists, and the phase's capacity goes to the presentation spine; [#698] and [#706] express user demand for the same capability and fold into it when it is scheduled.
- [#519] — kept open with recorded rationale (not a silent re-defer): still externally blocked on Pi SDK `UIContext` evolution; it closes or schedules when the SDK ships the capability.
- [#639] — deferred to a later phase: first sweep since filing, and its policy-model design budget does not fit alongside the presentation spine.
- [#742] — swept out of scope this phase by composition decision (first explicit sweep); it is the last member of the #306/#741 nested-command bypass family and is a strong candidate for the next phase's spine or an independent step.
- Feature issues [#736], [#720], [#691], [#688], [#687], [#686], [#680], [#658], [#610], [#609], [#604], [#603], [#699] — out of scope for a structural phase; [#654] and [#648] become downstream packages over the annotator and evidence-formatter seams per ADR 0011 §8, which are themselves deferred until the payload exists.

Trajectory: Phase 12's maximum step priority was 20; this phase's is 20 (Step 1).
No decline, so the regular rotation continues.

The presentation-directory, liveness-module, `decidedBy`, and `getAgentDir` rows grep for names the phase has not created yet; the step that creates each (Steps 1, 5, 6, 7 respectively) must either use the roadmap's name or update the metric row in the same commit.

### Steps

#### ✅ Step 1: `PromptPayload` and its builders — the assembly sites become one payload ([#744])

**Cause:** presentation is fused with decision-making — each gate renders its facts into a sentence at the point of decision, so no consumer downstream can render under its own budget; the flat `message` string is the fusion made concrete.

- **Smell:** Category C (coupling/boundary flaw — the payload/render boundary does not exist).
- **Target:** new `src/presentation/prompt-payload.ts` (the `PromptPayload` type per ADR 0011 §2 — `request` invariant core, `evidence`, `annotations` slot — plus builders); `permission-prompts.ts`, `handlers/gates/external-directory-messages.ts`, and the skill-prompt formatting migrate into `src/presentation/` as payload builders; the gate descriptors emit the payload alongside the facts they already compute; `PromptPermissionDetails` carries it; `message` is derived *from* the payload during the transition (lift-and-shift, no consumer changes yet).
  The payload's `request.executedUnit` carries the inner command of an unstrippable wrapper — [#713]'s fact, entering here.
  Tidy-first prep commit: extract the scout's duplicated fixtures (`makePermissionCheckResult`, a shared `ToolPreviewFormatter` factory) into `test/helpers/` and migrate the three presentation test files.
- **Outcome:** every ask has a complete structured payload; `grep -rn "formatAskPrompt" packages/pi-permission-system/src --include="*.ts" | wc -l` goes 4 → 0; `ls packages/pi-permission-system/src | grep -c presentation` goes 0 → 1; behavior is unchanged (the derived `message` is byte-compatible or near-compatible, pinned by existing tests).
- **Landed:** both metrics hit their targets, and `message` is byte-identical — every former assembler's string assertion now runs against `renderLegacyMessage`, which reads the payload alone, so the suite is the proof the payload is complete.
  `PromptPermissionDetails.payload` is **required**, making "every ask carries a complete payload" a compile-time guarantee rather than a convention.
  Planning found a **sixth** assembler the issue and ADR 0011 both omit — `formatPathAskPrompt`, with two consumers — and found that [#713]'s fact had no source at all: `classifyWrapperCommand` only flagged a wrapper, so the new `wrapper-analysis.ts` resolves what one actually runs.
  Three departures from ADR 0011 §2's illustrative type are documented at their declarations: a `kind` discriminant, `| null` over `| undefined` (the payload goes on the JSON wire in Step 3), and `commandContext` as a request fact.
- **Impact 5 / Risk 2 / Priority 20.**

Release: batch "presentation-payload"

#### ✅ Step 2: Bounded local renderers — the dialog and fallback render the payload under a budget ([#710])

**Cause:** same cause, consumed at the human's decision surface — with no renderer layer, the dialog shows whatever the assembler produced, so a subagent's oversized tool input takes over the parent's viewport and the operator decides blind or scrolls away the transcript.

- **Smell:** Category C, with the user-visible symptom filed as the [#710] bug.
- **Target:** new `src/presentation/dialog-renderer.ts` rendering the payload for the inline TUI dialog and the `select`/`input` fallback under a row budget plus a per-field width cap (ADR 0011 §5), with marked elision and a reachable complete view (§4); [#716]'s aligned one-fact-per-line rendering intent adopted here; the invariant core (§3) — including `executedUnit` — always visible, which closes [#713]; the row-budget config field follows the established `config-schema.ts` → `extension-config.ts` → `mergeUnifiedConfigs()` path (the #332/#347 drop class) with `pnpm run gen:schema`.
- **Outcome:** a forwarded ask with pathological input renders within the budget with the complete view reachable; [#710] and [#713] close; the local prompt path no longer reads `details.message`.
- **Landed:** the reported ask — a 200-line here-string, measured at 202 rows locally and 205 forwarded, identically at widths 80/120/160 — renders inside the 24-row default with its request facts intact.
  Planning settled the reading that makes that possible: §3's "never elided" means never *omitted*, so the field cap applies to the core and §5's own here-string rationale is coherent with it.
  The row budget therefore bounds evidence and the field cap bounds the core, with an entry admitted whole or dropped.
  `Ctrl+O` gained the dialog's own expansion alongside its host forward ([#642]) rather than a second binding, and the hint names it only when the render dropped something.
  PR [#738]'s highlight target is derived from the payload rather than carried as a `PromptPermissionDetails` field, so it cannot drift from the rendered text.
- **Impact 5 / Risk 3 / Priority 15.**

Release: batch "presentation-payload"

#### Step 3: The cross-boundary swap — payload replaces `message` on the wire and the broadcast ([#745])

**Cause:** same cause at the two cross-boundary contracts — the forwarded wire relays the child's prose (assembled under the child's config) and the broadcast ships the full sentence to any unconsented observer, so consistency across local and forwarded asks is structurally unattainable and the bus over-discloses.

- **Smell:** Category C (boundary flaw), with the ADR 0011 §6 broadcast narrowing as the disclosure fix.
- **Target:** `src/authority/permission-forwarding.ts` (the request carries the payload, `message` removed), `src/authority/approval-escalator.ts` (child serializes it), `src/authority/forwarded-request-server.ts` (serving renders the child's facts under the parent's budget; a version-skewed request without a payload renders from whatever fields it carries, never empty — ADR 0011 §9), `src/permission-ui-prompt.ts` (broadcast narrowed to the `request` facts; forwarded provenance retained in full), soft-deprecation of `toolInputPreviewMaxLength`/`toolTextSummaryMaxLength` via the config-issue channel (§5).
  Breaking: `feat!:` with a migration note naming the payload fields that supersede `message` on both contracts.
- **Outcome:** `grep -c "message: string"` goes 1 → 0 in both `permission-forwarding.ts` and `permission-ui-prompt.ts`; a forwarded ask renders identically in kind to a local one; the bus discloses request facts and verdicts only.
- **Impact 4 / Risk 3 / Priority 12.**

Release: batch "presentation-contract"

#### Step 4: The agent-facing and review-log renderers ([#746])

**Cause:** the same unbounded payload that took over the viewport is echoed verbatim into the agent's context on every denial (the human's constraint is rows; the agent's is tokens), and the review log persists prompt wording as a side effect of assembly rather than as a configured render.

- **Smell:** Category C, plus the log-growth concern of `docs/decisions/0010-permission-log-secret-exposure.md`.
- **Target:** `denial-messages.ts` migrates to `src/presentation/agent-renderer.ts` under ADR 0011 §7 — the agent renderer identifies the call (surface, matched pattern, verdict, the human's typed reason) and never reproduces its input; the review-log write path (`permission-prompter.ts` / `session-logger.ts`) renders the payload under its existing configured limits instead of persisting `message`.
- **Outcome:** denial text is structurally bounded (no raw-command interpolation on any denial path); the review log's growth is a configured decision; key-name redaction unchanged.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 2 / Priority 12.**

Release: batch "presentation-contract"

#### Step 5: Out-of-process forwarding liveness ([#721], fixes [#735] scenario 1)

**Cause:** the forwarding timeout conflates "a human is deliberating" with "nobody is home" — for an out-of-process child (which shares no `globalThis` with its parent) the 10-minute `PERMISSION_FORWARDING_TIMEOUT_MS` is the only signal, so every ask forwarded to a dead parent burns the full timeout and reports a denial the user never made.
The in-process serving registry (#719) already made the two distinguishable for in-process children; the filesystem channel lacks the equivalent.

- **Smell:** Category C (lifecycle/boundary flaw at the cross-process edge).
- **Target:** new `src/authority/forwarding-liveness.ts` (a filesystem liveness signal — [#721] names two candidate mechanisms, claim artifact or serving heartbeat; `/plan-issue` picks on ergonomics), `src/authority/forwarding-manager.ts` (serving node maintains the signal), `src/authority/approval-escalator.ts` (child fast-fails on absent/stale liveness after a short grace, with a path-naming `denialReason` and `confirmationUnavailable`, matching the in-process judgement's safe direction).
- **Outcome:** a child forwarding to a target no live session is draining abandons in seconds instead of 600, resolving [#735] scenario 1; scenario 2 stays with [#722]; `ls packages/pi-permission-system/src/authority | grep -c "forwarding-liveness"` goes 0 → 1.
- **Impact 4 / Risk 3 / Priority 12.**

Release: independent

#### Step 6: Decision provenance — `decidedBy` on permission decisions ([#726])

**Cause:** the decision path knows what decided (human prompt, session approval, config rule, authorizer link, auto-allow, timeout) and discards it before the log write, so an audit cannot distinguish a human approval from an auto-approval — the decision-provenance principle: record what decided and on what basis, not only the outcome.

- **Smell:** Category C (a fact established at the decision point dies before its consumer).
- **Target:** a `decidedBy` discriminated union threaded from the decision sites (`GateRunner`'s fast paths, `PermissionPrompter`, the `Authorizer` chain, `ForwardedRequestServer`) into the review-log entries and decision events; lands after Step 4 so the provenance fields ride the new log renderer rather than the retiring `message` shape.
- **Outcome:** every `permission_request.*` and decision event names its decider with enough detail to reconstruct the decision; `grep -rn "decidedBy" packages/pi-permission-system/src | wc -l` goes 0 → ≥ 1.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 1 / Priority 15.**

Release: independent

#### Step 7: Model-judge honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` ([#732])

**Cause:** `pi-permission-model-judge` recomputes the global config scope from a hardcoded `~/.pi/agent` instead of the SDK's `getAgentDir()`, so the two packages disagree about where the global scope lives whenever `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is set — and the configured judge silently never registers, indistinguishable in the review log from "not installed".

- **Smell:** Category F (cross-package divergence on a single source of truth).
- **Target:** `packages/pi-permission-model-judge/src/config-loader.ts` resolves `agentDir` via `getAgentDir()` from `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, as pi-permission-system does.
- **Outcome:** both packages read the global scope from the same directory; `grep -c "getAgentDir" packages/pi-permission-model-judge/src/config-loader.ts` goes 0 → ≥ 1; ships as a `fix:` in the model-judge component.
- **Impact 3 / Risk 1 / Priority 15.**

Release: independent

#### Step 8: `deriveApprovalPattern` takes the injected `PathFlavor` ([#655])

**Cause:** `deriveApprovalPattern` (`session-rules.ts`) reads `node:path`'s ambient `dirname`/`sep`, bypassing the injected `PathFlavor` that owns every other platform decision — the one surviving violation of the #562/#510 invariant, producing mixed-separator patterns on a real Windows host and untestable win32 behavior on POSIX CI.

- **Smell:** Category C (ambient platform read; decide-once violation).
- **Target:** `src/session-rules.ts` — derive the pattern through the flavor's `impl`/separator, threading the flavor from the call sites that already hold a `PathNormalizer`.
- **Outcome:** `grep -c "node:path" packages/pi-permission-system/src/session-rules.ts` goes 1 → 0; a win32 unit test can pin the derived pattern; `refactor:` (hidden type — cuts no release on its own).
- **Impact 2 / Risk 1 / Priority 10.**

Release: independent

- **Track B — forwarding liveness:** Step 5 (touches `authority/` forwarding files only; disjoint from Track A apart from `approval-escalator.ts`, which Track A's Step 3 also edits — land Step 5 before or after Step 3, not concurrently).
- **Track C — decision provenance:** Step 6, after Step 4.
- **Track D — independent fixes:** Steps 7 and 8, any time.

### Release batches

- **Batch "presentation-payload":** Steps 1, 2 (ship together; tail = Step 2; release vehicle = Step 2's `fix:` for [#710] — Step 1 is a hidden `refactor:`).
- **Batch "presentation-contract":** Steps 3, 4 (ship together; tail = Step 4; release vehicle = Step 3's `feat!:` breaking release with the `message`-replacement migration note).
- Independently releasable: Step 5 (`fix:`), Step 6 (`feat:`), Step 7 (`fix:`, model-judge component), Step 8 (`refactor:` — hidden type, batches into the next release).

## Refactoring history

The architecture above is the product of twelve completed improvement phases.
Each phase's findings, numbered plan, dependency diagram, and health metrics are preserved in a per-phase history file under [`history/`](history/).
