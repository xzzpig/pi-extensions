# Retro: #859 — pi-permission-system: git revision ranges are classified as path candidates, raising false external_directory asks

## Stage: Planning (2026-09-23T03:22:11Z)

### Session summary

Planned the Phase 15 step for this issue: both token classifiers now treat `..` as a path signal only when it is a whole segment, through one private `hasParentTraversal` predicate, adopting `TacoTakumi`'s regex with a `Co-authored-by:` trailer.
I reproduced the issue through the real `BashProgram` and measured the blast radius over an 8360-command review-log corpus.
I also filed the brace-expansion residual as [#968] and recorded its disposition in the roadmap: deferred to a later phase, beside [#822].

### Observations

- **Third-party direction gate:** the operator adopted the predicate for both classifiers, as the roadmap step already specified, rather than the posted patch's strict-only scope.
- **Corpus diff (measured, both classifiers):** `external_directory` loses 28 tokens across 27 commands and `path` loses 92 across 85, with 0 gained on either surface.
  Every lost token is a revision range, a bare `...`, or prose inside a quoted argument.
  An ask disappears entirely in only 2 commands, and both were false positives.
  With the predicate applied, the full suite stayed green (4584 tests), so the Red comes only from new tests.
- **The trigger is wider than the issue says.**
  A *known* base outside the cwd (an absolute `cd /elsewhere && git log a..b`) also flagged the range, because it resolved to `/elsewhere/a..b`.
  In the corpus those asks were already carried by the `cd` target, so only their evidence lists get shorter.
- **Brace expansion is a pre-existing gap.**
  With a known base, `cat {..,y}/z` is not flagged today; with an unknown base it was flagged only because the substring test happened to match it.
  The operator chose the separator-only predicate and a follow-up issue ([#968]) over widening the boundary set to `{ , }`.
- **The rule classifier's `..` branch becomes almost unreachable.**
  Only a POSIX backslash form (`foo\..`) reaches it once `startsWith(".")` and `hasPathSeparator` have run.
  It is kept for a single definition of "parent traversal"; whether to delete it under the #520 posture is recorded as an Open Question.
- **Tidy First:** one `refactor:` step was accepted, which extracts the current `includes("..")` into a shared predicate before the behavior change.
  The assessor confirmed the probe fall-through (`probeBareToken` returns `null` under an unknown base before it touches the filesystem) and found no existing test that asserts an in-segment `..` is accepted.

#### Deferred tidyings

- `test/access-intent/bash/token-classification.test.ts`: the two near-duplicate "shared rejection: rejectNonPathToken" blocks (one per classifier) could share one table-driven test.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-09-23T03:35:39Z)

### Session summary

Completed all three plan steps: the `refactor:` extraction of `hasParentTraversal`, the `fix:` that makes it a whole-segment `PARENT_TRAVERSAL_SEGMENT_PATTERN` (co-authored with `TacoTakumi`), and the roadmap `docs:` commit with the ✅ marks and a `Landed:` note.
The package suite went from 4584 to 4590 tests (+6: two unit tests in `token-classification.test.ts`, four in `program.test.ts`).

### Observations

- **Red matched the plan exactly.** 4 tests failed at Red (the two in-segment unit tests and the two `program.test.ts` range tests), and the three invariant pins (the `a/../../b` control, the `v1..v2` symlink, and the whole-segment positives) passed as predicted.
- **All five named mutations were killed.**
  In-segment: 4 reds.
  Rule call site only: 2 reds, with the strict tests green.
  Token edge (drop `$`): 2 reds; it also killed the rule classifier's POSIX `foo\..` positive, which is a trailing-edge case too, one more than the plan named.
  Backslash: 2 reds.
  Probe fall-through: 4 reds, including the new symlink test and three pre-existing #645/#694 pins.
- **The scripted `perl` mutation for the token edge matched nothing** (the pattern unchanged, and 367 green).
  I caught it because `grep` showed the pattern unchanged, then re-applied it with `Edit`.
  The regex-escaping layers (shell, `perl`, the JS regex source) make a scripted mutation of a regex literal unreliable, so `Edit` is the tool for it.
- **The corpus re-run matched the plan.**
  It covered 8375 commands (the log grew by 15): `external_directory` 28 tokens lost across 27 commands, `path` 93 lost across 86, 0 gained, 0 lost tokens with a whole `..` segment, and 2 commands losing every external access.
  The one extra `path` loss is this session's own `refactor:` commit message (prose containing ` .. `).
  The pre-change output was captured at the `refactor:` commit, before the `fix:` landed.
- **One slip in the docs step:** the first `Edit` wrote the check-mark as a literal `\u2705` escape in the heading and the Mermaid node, and the retro's first draft repeated the slip for an em-dash.
  The addendum's literal-character rule governs `newText` as much as `oldText`.
  `grep` caught it, and I replaced it with the character before committing.
- **Pre-completion reviewer: WARN.**
  It found no defects: it enumerated about 30 candidate tokens (including `$VAR/..`, `$HOME/..`, `./..`, `.../x`, and quoted forms) and confirmed that each classifies as intended.
  Its single finding is that its read-only mandate kept it from re-running the corpus spike, which it disclosed rather than reporting as verified.

## Stage: Sync (worktree) (2026-09-23T03:43:52Z)

### Session summary

Pre-push checks (`pnpm run lint`, `pnpm fallow dead-code`) both pass with no findings.
No deferred work: all three plan steps landed, and the plan's `**Release:** ship independently` marker applies with no batch to coordinate against.
The filed follow-up ([#968], brace expansion) is deferred to a later phase and needs no action at land time.

**Peer session transcript:** `/Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-chris-development-pi-pi-packages-worktrees-issue-859--/2026-09-23T02-30-00-576Z_01a0cc19-3a80-7609-b4f6-32ea900f03b7.jsonl`, read with `read_session_file({ path: "<path>" })` for message-level verification at land/retro time.

### Observations

Nothing further to add beyond the TDD and Planning stage notes above.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-09-23T03:55:00Z)

### Session summary

The root `/ship` fast-forward-merged the peer branch, passed CI, closed the issue, and released `pi-permission-system-v33.0.8`.
It then tore down the worktree.
Across all four stages the fix itself went cleanly: Red matched the plan, all five mutations were killed, and the corpus re-run matched the planning measurement.
The friction was all process: literal `\uXXXX` escapes in authored markdown, one scripted mutation that silently did not apply, and a close comment drafted without the voice skill.

### Observations

#### What went well

- **The `PRE_MERGE` anchor rule fired as designed.**
  The branch carried a pre-plan commit (`docs(pi-permission-system): disposition #968 against Phase 15`) that the plan-anchored range could not see.
  `/ship`'s ancestor test surfaced it, and the release-candidate check confirmed it touched only `pi-permission-system`.
- **The corpus before/after was captured at the right commits.**
  The TDD stage took the "before" snapshot at the `refactor:` commit, before the `fix:` landed.
  So the re-run could attribute its one extra `path` loss to a specific token: the session's own commit-message prose.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `instruction-violation` (self-identified, three times, two models): a literal `\u2705` or `\u2014` escape was written into markdown by an `Edit`.
  This happened once in the TDD roadmap edit and once in the TDD retro note (both Opus 5.5), then again in the sync retro note (Sonnet 5), which said "the same em-dash escape mistake again".
  The addendum and `markdown-conventions` already forbid it.
  Impact: about 2–3 repair tool calls each, all caught by `grep` before commit; the sync note then recorded "nothing further to add" instead of the slip.
  This is the case [#967] makes for a gate over prose.
- `instruction-violation` (self-identified): the TDD stage ran a killing mutation (M3, the token-edge regex) as a scripted `perl -pi` substitution without loading `edit-tool`.
  That skill already warns that a backslash-bearing replacement goes through three escape levels.
  The substitution matched nothing, and the suite stayed green (367).
  Impact: 1 extra tool call, since a follow-up `grep` showed the pattern unchanged; unnoticed, a mutation that never applied reads as a surviving mutation and invites unnecessary tests.
- `instruction-violation` (self-identified at retro): `/ship` step 9 says to load `github-voice` before drafting, but the ship session drafted and published the close comment without it.
  Step 1.4's up-front skill load lists `git-workflow`, `releasing`, and `worktrees`, and says "the close comment … sit[s] on rules those carry", but it does not list `github-voice`.
  Impact: the published comment carries a garbled clause ("both classifiers now credit the reporter via Co-authored-by").
- `other`: in the ship session's lint gate, `rc=$?; …; [ $rc -ne 0 ] && tail` made the tool report exit 1 on a passing lint.
  The prompt's recipe is `|| tail`.
  Impact: 1 extra tool call to read the log.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- None observed.
  The operator's two gates in planning (classifier scope, and #968's roadmap disposition) were strategic, and each was answered once.

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation:**
  - Planning and TDD ran on `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`, which is appropriate for the corpus design and the mutation plan.
  - Sync ran on `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`, which is appropriate for mechanical work.
  - Both subagents ran on `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`, attributed from their own transcripts.
    The `tidy-first-assessor` confirmed the probe fall-through with line citations.
    The `pre-completion-reviewer` enumerated about 30 tokens against the shipped regex.
    No quality mismatch.
  - Ship ran on `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`; the one quality slip there (the close-comment clause) is a skipped skill load, not model capability.
- **Unused-tool detection:** the `edit-tool` skill (an `AGENTS.md` index row for "a scripted substitution") was not loaded before the `perl` mutations; it already names the backslash-escape trap.
- **Feedback-loop gap analysis:** none.
  TDD ran full baseline gates, targeted `vitest` after each Red, Green, and mutation, and full gates again before the reviewer.

### Changes made

1. `.pi/prompts/ship.md`: step 1.4 now loads `github-voice` alongside `git-workflow` and `releasing`, so the close comment's skill is in context before step 9.
2. `.pi/skills/testing/SKILL.md`: added one line to confirm a mutation applied (`git diff --stat`) before reading its run.
3. Edited the published #859 close comment to replace the garbled credit clause, thank the reporter, and name the released version.
4. Commented on [#967] with this issue's three occurrences of literal `\uXXXX` escapes across two models.
