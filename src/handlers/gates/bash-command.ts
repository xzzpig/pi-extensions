/**
 * Resolve the bash command-pattern decision for a (possibly chained) command.
 *
 * A bash invocation may be a shell program with several commands joined by
 * `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `&`, or newlines. Matching the whole string against the
 * bash patterns lets a denied command ride through on an allowed leading one
 * (issue #301). Instead, the caller supplies the program's command units (from
 * the shared `BashProgram.commands()` parse) — including those nested inside
 * substitutions and subshells (#306); each is evaluated on the `bash` surface
 * and the most restrictive result wins (`deny > ask > allow`).
 *
 * The selected result carries the offending sub-command in `command`, its rule
 * in `matchedPattern`, and the offending command's execution context in
 * `commandContext` (set only for a nested command), so the prompt,
 * session-approval suggestion, and decision event scope to that command.
 *
 * A wrapper unit (flagged with a `wrapperKind` by the enumerator) hides or
 * indirects the command that should be gated, so an `allow` is floored up to a
 * synthetic `ask` — the `<opaque-bash-wrapper>` pattern for an inline-shell
 * payload (`bash -c`/`eval`, #481) or `<indirection-bash-wrapper>` for a
 * prefix/exec wrapper (`sudo`/`env`/`xargs`/`find -exec`/…, #490) — to keep it
 * from riding a permissive rule; an explicit `deny`/`ask` on the wrapper is left
 * untouched (`deny > ask > allow`).
 *
 * A trivially-empty command (an empty, whitespace-only, or comment-only line)
 * has genuinely nothing to gate, so the whole `command` is resolved as before.
 *
 * When the *primary* parse matched nothing, the whole command string is the
 * only surface an explicit `deny` can reach, so it is resolved first and a
 * `deny` covering it denies outright rather than being masked into an
 * approvable prompt (#712). With no units at all the result also fails closed
 * to a synthetic `ask`, so a permissive top-level `*` cannot silently allow an
 * unparseable command (e.g. `cd /repo && git push` riding a top-level allow on
 * the empty-parse path) — #452. A command whose units are *all* salvaged
 * (#875) takes the same whole-string check, because its primary parse matched
 * nothing either; only the synthetic `ask` is skipped, since the recovered
 * units now carry the verdict.
 *
 * A *partial* parse failure is the other half of that clause: the units the
 * recovery produced are enumerated normally, and any one the enumerator marked
 * {@link BashCommand.parseUnresolved} has its `allow` floored to a synthetic
 * `ask` naming the whole command (`<unparsed-bash-subtree>`, #840), because
 * recovered structure is not evidence of what runs.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous: the (async, tree-sitter) parse happens once in the
 * handler, which passes the decomposed `commands` here.
