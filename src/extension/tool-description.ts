Use async:false only when the parent must block until completion. Async mode still shows progress. Final reviews and gate checks stay async; needing a result is not a blocking reason.

Ordinary async subagents notify this session natively, so return control and do not call bg_wait merely to get a completion wake.

• ${WORKFLOW_HOST_GUIDANCE}
• Ordinary child subagents are not orchestrators. Only explicitly configured fanout children may use the child-safe subagent tool, still bounded by depth/session limits.
• Oracle/advisor consultations should use supervisor dialogue for material unknowns when available; request one-shot only when desired.
• Keep one writer for the same cwd/worktree. Use fresh-context read-only reviewers for independent review, then have the parent synthesize and apply fixes.
• Async runs expose asyncId/asyncDir with status.json, events.jsonl, output logs, status via { action: "status", id }, and lifecycle diagnostics via { action: "debug.run", id }. Include output paths and residual risks when reporting results.`;

${WORKFLOW_RESOURCE_GUIDANCE}

EXECUTION:
• ${EXTERNAL_CLI_RUNNER_GUIDANCE}
• ${AGENT_SELECTION_GUIDANCE}
• When passing an explicit model to a child (on the call or a runs.run/runs.all item), first call { action: "models" } and copy an exact provider/id; bare ids resolve only when unique in the registry, and agent names (e.g. gpt-pro, advisor) are not model ids. Set per-run thinking with a suffix on the model string (e.g. provider/id:high; off/minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh/max); the suffix wins over the agent's thinking default. The thinking field only applies to action='watchdog.configure' and is ignored on dispatch.
• SINGLE CHILD: { agent:"worker", task:"..." }. This structured form starts exactly one direct child. Fields such as model, context, cwd, worktree, output, budgets, acceptance, and async apply to that child. Do not combine agent/task with action, workflowScript, or workflowScriptPath.
• WORKFLOW SCRIPT: { workflowScript: "return runs.run('main', {agent:'worker', task:'...'})" }. Use stable-key runs.run for one child and await runs.all([{key,agent,task}, ...]) for ordinary parallel children. runs.all resolves to an ordered array, not a key map, so use results[0], array destructuring, or results.map((result) => result.output), not results.<key>. Do not read .output from unawaited runs.run launches. Stored runs.run promises are only for advanced rolling fanout and each must later be observed with direct await, Promise.race, or Promise.all. Ordinary JavaScript provides sequence, branching, filtering, retries, and aggregation. workflowScript is an ordinary JavaScript statement body, so use an explicit return for a useful result. Use top-level await, plain helper functions, or explicit Promise chains; nested async function, arrow, and method helpers are rejected. For task text with Markdown fences or shell blocks, build quoted lines instead of nesting raw template literals: \`const task=["Run:","\`\`\`bash","npm test","\`\`\`"].join("\\n")\`. Scripts normally start async unless config sets asyncByDefault:false; set async:true explicitly when async behavior matters. Pass async:false only when the parent must block until completion, never for final reviews or gates. Same-repo blocking workflows default to a live in-chat card; explicit live-card requires same-repository async:false, so async workflows should omit chatProgress or use auto/off. Workflow-level child controls default onto each runs.run launch, and explicit child fields override them. Use {action:"children.list"} to list recent retained workflow children with resumable/not-resumable reasons. Resume only rows reported resumable. For a simple follow-up or implementation challenge, use {action:"resume", id:"run-id", message:"..."}. Resume keeps the stored agent/model/tool contract. If no resumable child is listed, launch a same-role fallback challenge and label it as fallback. Inside workflowScript, continue one with runs.run(key, {resume:"run-id", task:"follow-up"}); workflow resumes wait for completed output, and loops must continue from each latest returned runId. Await runs.steer(key, message, {mode?, index?, ackTimeoutMs?}) to guide a prior keyed child without exposing its run id; receipts are queued, delivered, missed, or failed. Always await or return runs.steer. For repository mutation lanes, set worktree:true on the workflow or individual runs.run/runs.all item for managed isolation; each parallel child gets a separate worktree and handoff artifact. Set baseRef to a safe Git ref (default HEAD) to choose the managed worktree starting commit; the source checkout must still be clean. A workflow usageBudget is enforced once across the workflow. Available globals are runs.run, runs.all, runs.steer, runs.status, runs.ref/refs, emit, console, and standard JavaScript only. Workflows get async state.get(key) and state.set(key, JSONValue) through their automatic or explicit mission; mission:false workflows do not have a state global. Scripts cannot access filesystem, shell, arbitrary Pi tools, or host globals.
• ${WORKFLOW_LANES_GUIDANCE}
• FILE SCRIPT: { workflowScriptPath:"workflows/review.js" }. Relative paths resolve against the request cwd. The host reads the file before the filesystem-free workflow sandbox starts. Do not combine this field with workflowScript.
• Sequential example: { workflowScript: "const a = await runs.run('analyze', {agent:'agent-a', task:'Analyze the request'}); return (await runs.run('plan', {agent:'agent-b', task:'Plan from: '+a.output})).output" }
• Parallel example: { workflowScript: "const [a,b] = await runs.all([{key:'correctness',agent:'agent-a',task:'Review correctness'},{key:'tests',agent:'agent-b',task:'Review tests'}]); return {correctness:a.output,tests:b.output}" }
• Optional context is "fresh", "fork", or "profile". profile requires the selected agent's declared defaultContext and ignores config defaultSubagentContext. Explicit fresh/fork wins. When omitted, config defaultSubagentContext wins over agent defaultContext. Config forkContext can summarize transcript overflow with stable recovery refs before spawn without adding another public context value. timeoutMs/maxRuntimeMs apply to foreground and async workflows; foreground workflows default to 30 minutes and async workflows have no default timeout. Omit acceptance for reviewer/read-only calls; evidence levels end at verified, and acceptance.review.required requests independent writer review.
• Durable mission attachment is automatic by default. Use missionId to attach an existing mission, mission:{...} to override auto-create, or mission:false for ephemeral work. A mission object needs exactly one non-empty title or summary; objective and labels are optional. goal may only be true and requires budget:{tokens}.

MANAGEMENT / CONTROL (use action; omit execution fields):
• validate checks workflowScript or workflowScriptPath syntax and statically decidable structure without launching children. list, get, models, guide, children.list, create, update, delete, eject, disable, enable, reset, status, debug.run, doctor, grant-spawn-budget, worktree.discard, worktree.cleanup (plan-only), lane.status, lane.recordMerge, lane.recordSupersession, refine/refine.show/refine.rollback, mission.create/list/show/update/resolve-decision/attach-run/close, inspector.open/status/close, project.open/status/close, and watchdog actions remain available. Use {action:"guide", topic:"overview"} for packaged current-version help; topics are overview, workflows, agents, missions, observability, tool-reference, configuration, models, watchdog, and extension-api.
• status, interrupt, stop, resume, and steer manage live or persisted runs. Use status view:"fleet" for an overview or view:"transcript" with id and optional index to tail output.
• Create durable project schedules with { action:"schedule.create", id?, name?, sessionOnly?:true, at:"+10m" | ISO, baseRef?, workflowScript:"return runs.run('main', {agent:'worker', task:'...'})" }, or use workflowScriptPath instead. An optional baseRef selects the safe Git ref used by managed worktrees (default HEAD); the source checkout must still be clean. With sessionOnly:true, the schedule records the creating session file and only that session can restore or execute it; omitted/false preserves project-wide behavior. Manage them with schedule.list/show/history/pause/resume/run/run-due/delete. This first slice supports fixed intervals; calendar schedules and schedule mission attachment are deferred.

• A mission object needs exactly one non-empty title or summary; objective and labels are optional. goal may only be true and requires budget:{tokens}.

ASYNC / SAFETY:
• Omitted async follows asyncByDefault config; set async:true explicitly when async behavior matters.
