 * Semantics:
 * - `undefined` allowedHosts = no allowlist configured

 * - `{allowedHosts: [...], deniedHosts: [...]}` = apply allow/deny rules

 * Note: Empty `allowedHosts` means no host matches an allow rule (unlike
 * read's empty denyOnly). Whether an unmatched host is denied outright
 * depends on the ask callback: deniedHosts are checked first and deny
 * unconditionally; a host matching neither list falls through to the
 * registered SandboxAskCallback when one exists, and is denied only when
 * no callback is registered. Hosts needing a hard block-all regardless of
 * callback behavior should use a `deniedHosts` wildcard.
