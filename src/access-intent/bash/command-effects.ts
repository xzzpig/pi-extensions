 * | `gawk`, `nawk`                                  | Their own dialects' options are unaudited; `awk` is guarded instead |
 * | `uniq`                                          | `uniq IN OUT` writes its second positional                     |
 * | `tee`, `dd`, `split`, `csplit`, `xxd`, `tree`, `curl`, `wget` | Each has a positional or option that writes a file |
 * | `less`, `more`                                  | Interactive shell escape (`!cmd`) and `LESSOPEN` preprocessing |
 * | `file`                                          | `-C`/`--compile` writes a `magic.mgc` file — it reports on its arguments, but not only |
 * | `git`, `pnpm`, `npm`, `node`, `python3`, `gh`   | Subcommand- and argument-dependent — the `commandEffects` long tail |
 *
 * Widening the roster only ever loosens, so evidence can add a word as a
