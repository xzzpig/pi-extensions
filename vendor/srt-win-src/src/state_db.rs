//! Cross-broker state DB for `srt-win acl` — refcount additive
//! sandbox-user ACEs (grant ALLOW / stamp DENY) so the LAST broker
//! to release a path can drop the ACE.
//!
//! Lives at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sandbox-runtime\state.db` (rusqlite,
//! WAL). The directory is ACL-stamped real-user-only `(OI)(CI)` on
//! every open so the sandbox child cannot tamper with the refcount.
//!
//! ## Disk-is-truth invariant
//!
//! A row is a refcount edge + `file_id` identity check. It NEVER
//! asserts on-disk state. Every add/drop/crash-recover routes
//! through [`recompose_at`], which reads the live `working_aces`
//! rows for the path and converges the on-disk ACEs for the
//! sandbox SID to exactly that set (walk-and-filter, no PROTECTED
//! rewrite, no SD snapshot). A poisoned row therefore degrades to
//! "sandbox user has an extra ACE the user can manually remove",
//! never to attacker-chosen permissions on the user's own files.
//!
//! ## Locking and crash safety
//!
//! Every `acl stamp|grant|restore|revoke|recover` runs under a
//! single named mutex `Local\sandbox-runtime-acl-init`
//! (real-user-only DACL). The mutex — NOT a DB transaction —
//! serializes whole operations across brokers; `WAIT_ABANDONED`
//! tells us the previous holder died mid-op (crash-recovery
//! already runs unconditionally).
//!
//! There is deliberately NO single enclosing transaction. Each
//! path's (FS mutation + row change) commits independently so a
//! failure on path Y can't revert path X. The one ordering rule is
//! record-first: upsert, THEN `SetNamedSecurityInfoW`. A crash
//! between leaves a row whose ACE hasn't been written; the next
//! call re-derives and reapplies.
