# Contributing to pi-starline

Thanks for your interest in pi-starline. This document covers the workflow and conventions used in this repository.

## Development setup

Requirements: Node.js and npm. pi-starline is a Pi extension package, so you'll also want a working `pi` binary for local testing.

```bash
npm install
npm run verify      # biome check + tsc --noEmit + vitest run
npm run pack:check  # npm pack --dry-run, sanity-checks published contents
```

Before opening a pull request, please run `npm run fmt` and then `npm run verify` again.

## Local Pi testing

The package is loaded by Pi from `package.json` via the `pi.extensions` field. Use the dev scripts to iterate without publishing:

```bash
npm run pi:dev              # runs pi with only this extension loaded
npm run pi:install-local    # installs the local checkout into your pi extensions
```

If your `pi` binary is not at the default path, override it:

```bash
PI_BIN=/absolute/path/to/pi npm run pi:dev
```

Manual testing is required for any change that affects the footer, editor, user-message styling, runtime/git detection, colors, or `/starline` settings.

## Coding expectations

Please follow the conventions already in this repo. The most important ones:

- **Preserve Nerd Font / private-use icon glyphs.** Many of the icons are private-use Unicode characters; it is easy to replace them with empty strings by accident.
- **Keep `extensions/starline/index.ts` orchestration-focused.** Rendering, formatting, and parsing logic belong in focused modules such as `footer.ts`, `format.ts`, `style.ts`, `git.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `ui.ts`, or `user-message.ts`.
- **Use focused modules.** New rendering or formatting code should generally go into the matching module rather than being inlined.
- **Silent fallbacks are intentional.** Git, runtime detection, and config lookups fail silently so that a broken environment does not break the session. Do not add throws or noisy errors for these paths without a strong reason.
- **`user-message.ts` patches `UserMessageComponent`.** Treat it as fragile and avoid changes unless they are necessary.
- **Runtime color values follow Starship's terminal style strings** (e.g. `bold purple`, `fg:202`, `bg:blue`).

## Pull request expectations

- Describe the user-facing behavior change in the PR summary.
- Include screenshots or a short recording for footer, editor, user-message, or rendering changes.
- Run `npm run verify` and `npm run pack:check` locally.
- Keep the diff surgical. Don't refactor adjacent code, reformat unrelated files, or upgrade dependencies that aren't part of the fix.
- Use a conventional commit-style subject (e.g. `feat: add ...`, `fix: handle ...`), lowercase after the type, imperative, and concise. No trailing period.
- Reviews are assigned to `@Andy8647` via `CODEOWNERS`.

## Reporting issues

Please use the GitHub issue forms in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) so reports include the environment, config, and Pi/Starline version context needed to triage them:

- Bug report
- Rendering, icon, or color issue
- Feature request
- Runtime/language detection
- Config or usage question

For core Pi issues outside Starline's footer, editor, and message styling, please open the issue upstream in the Pi project instead.
